he is famous for his exposés of the seedy side of la life , interviewing everyone from porn stars to pet obsessives in a bid to shine a light on the parts of hollywood where the cameras do not go now louis theroux has turned his attentions to a completely different part of la life the dying and unearthed an incredible survival story in the process . when theroux first met langston , 22 , he was in a coma and not expected to survive . but 37 days later and in the face of overwhelming odds of a million to one , the college athlete woke up new direction : theroux goes behind the scenes at la 's cedars sinai to explore the dying process i was amazed , reveals theroux . the doctors had repeatedly told us – and told his family – that the best case scenario for him would be that he remained in a vegetative state . best case so to have him wake up and walk again and converse normally was mind blowing . i remember being in the office when my director came off the phone from langston s sister and said he d woken up i didn t believe him . it just goes to show , doctors don t know everything . seeing him reunited with his twin brother after he woke up was one of the most moving things i ve ever seen . so how did a 22 year old athlete come to be in a coma ? the answer is a drug overdose that left him with severely compromised liver and kidney function and traumatic brain damage . doctors at la 's cedars sinai medical center were convinced that the damage was too severe to make recovery possible and had told the family that it would be better to let him go harrowing : langston in hospital with his aunt sheila and louis . doctors were convinced he would not survive survivor : incredibly , and against all odds , langston woke up after 37 days in a coma the family , by contrast , were equally convinced that he would survive and their faith was rewarded when after more than a month , he opened his eyes . i m grateful and i am thankful to god , his delighted sister andrea tells theroux , but i knew he was going to get better i knew he was going to be ok that optimism is at the heart of theroux 's new film , la stories : edge of life an optimism that sees doctors , families and patients continuing to treat patients long after they would have been dispatched to a hospice in the uk it s the nature of the way healthcare is funded in america , explains theroux . if you have insurance , then beyond a certain threshold of cost , everything is covered , with virtually no upper limit . so there is a temptation to try everything . which in some ways is good because there are so many options available . but it s also the case that , given the vast amounts the us spends on healthcare compared with other industrialised nations , the us life expectancy is not what it should be and while langston manages a miraculous recovery , the other severely ill stars of the show donta , a 31 year old with rectal cancer and javier , a 29 year old suffering from leukaemia do not . i knew they were at a high risk of dying soon , explains theroux . it was deeply affecting to see them live through some of the most dramatic and u.s.tting experiences of their lives . but , as strange as it may sound , both donta and javier took strength from having the camera there as a witness to their struggle . miracle : langston with his mother lyle and sister ashley neither of whom ever gave up hope i m good : what langston , pictured with twin brother lorne , when he returned to thank them wouldonta had always worked on the fringes of show business and he loved the idea of being on a mainstream tv programme . he wrote glowingly about it on facebook . and javier seemed to appreciate having someone from the outside talking to him about what he was going through . the tale of the two men also illustrates the differences between end of life care in the us and the uk not least in terms of the amount of money involved . in donta 's case , the treatment he received in hospital cost more than $2 million a lot , you might imagine , for what ultimately turned out to be a futile attempt to save him . so is it right to spend so much on one man that could have been put to use elsewhere ? theroux finds the question a tough one to answer . he had a massive amount of surgery to remove his anal cancer – which had spread to his liver , he muses . this was a long shot procedure , especially given that he had a weakened immune system . his recovery was slow and painful , and in fact his wound never healed , which contributed to his death . not so lucky : javier , who also appears in theroux film , in happier times before succumbing to leukaemia last moments : javier married his girlfriend a few days before he died a moment captured in the documentary it seems to me that – in a world of finite resources – it wasn t the best use of the two million . but i try to put myself in donta s position and i can understand the motivation to get it done , and likewise the doctor s urge to do the best for donta . questions about morality and money aside , at heart , the film is about death and how people deal with it whether that is staving it off for as long as they can or accepting it parts are quite simply heart breaking : the moment when donta sobs after being told that nothing more can be done for him or when javier marries his girlfriend in a bedside ceremony . ultimately , it is oddly uplifting both because of donta and javier 's bravery and because of langston 's dramatic recovery . after 37 days in intensive care and seven weeks in rehab , the man who everyone thought would end his life as a vegetable strides , beaming , back into the hospital to thank the staff who saved his life . i m good , he tells the doctor . proof that , for all its perceived flaws , the american health system can provide some lucky families with miracle . louis theroux 's la stories : edge of life , sunday night at 9 pm on bbc2 he is no stranger to the weird and wonderful and now louis theroux is to tackle one of the weirdest and most wonderful religions of them all scientology . scientology is the quintessential hollywood religion , he explains . i ve been trying to make for years and now we ve got funding to do it as a feature documentary film . i just put out an appeal on twitter for scientologists to speak to me for the film . they tend not to do much media so we ll have to wait and see what comes back . but that is not all . now based in los angeles , a city that he continues to find fascinating , theroux is planning more films , although he says subjects are still to be finalised . la embodies the best and worst of america , he explains . wouldivisions of wealth , vulgarity , energy , breathtaking landscapes , beaches , mountains , deserts , and tracts of crappy housing covering much of the above . talented , funny , creative people creating art that entertains the world and also a certain level of incuriousness about that world . people run the gamut . there is a prejudice that angelenos are shallow and touchy feely . that is definitely one part of the truth . there is a surface friendliness that doesn t always run that deep , but then surface friendliness is better than surface unfriendliness .:==:langston , a 22 year old from la , appears in louis theroux la stories . was in a coma and was not expected to survive his severe brain damage . theroux says seeing him overcome the odds was amazing . new film focuses on the end of life care on offer in hospitals in la theroux also meets cancer sufferers donta , 31 , and javier , 29 . louis theroux la stories : edge of life is on sunday at 9 pm on bbc2 .

blue light emitting diodes have been receiving positive attention after its inventors were awarded the nobel prize in physics last week . they use around 90 per cent less energy than incandescent bulbs and last for 100,000 hours compared with 1,000 hours for tungsten filament light bulbs . but while they may be good for the environment , a new study claims that the discovery may a problem for insects , which are more strongly attracted to the led spectrum of light . while blue leds may be good for the environment , a new study claims that the discovery may a problem for insects , which are more strongly attracted to the led spectrum of light the research , by new zealand based institute scion , found traps placed near leds captured 48 per cent more insects than traps near sodium vapour lights . sodium vapour bulbs , which emit yellow light , are commonly used in street lighting as they are more efficient than pre led lights . insects are attracted to both white and yellow light , but it seems they are even more attracted to blue light which is generated by led bulbs . overall , the researchers caught and labelled more than 20,000 insects , with moths and flies the most common group of bugs . they claim the attraction can be fatal , causing flies to be thrown off their usual path and into the jaws of predators , disrupting the food chain . three japanese born scientists have won the nobel prize in physics for inventing blue light emitting diodes that have revolutionised the lighting industry . isamu akasaki and hiroshi amano of japan and u.s. scientist shuji nakamura won the award for their 1990 s invention , which has led to the use of environmentally friendly light sources worldwide . but when nakamura invented the technology in 1993 , the company he worked for at the time awarded him the equivalent of just £125 $200 despite the idea being worth a potential £50 billion $80 billion by 2020 according to estimates . shuji nakamura invented the blue light emitting diode while working for the nichia corporation in tokushima , japan in 1993 . but when he first came up with nichia rewarded him with just 20,000 yen £125 or $200 , as japanese firms favoured the mentality that work for an employer was not a means for personal glory . however nakamura quit and moved to the us in 2000 , before counter suing in 2001 after nichia attempted to sue him for infringing trade secrets . he was ultimately awarded £5.04 million $8.1 million for the idea , reported as the largest payout ever made to an employee for an invention . shuji nakamura , isamu akasaki and hiroshi amano , all born in japan , have won the 2014 nobel physics prize , for their environmentally friendly blue leds . the lighting breakthrough creates more energy efficient home lighting , and can improve keyhole surgery techniques another concern is that led lights near ports could attract flying pests , such as the gypsy moth , that are accidentally transported by ships . the behavior of many animals is influenced by light in the blue portion of the spectrum . for example , insects have specific photoreceptors for blue light , stephen pawson , an entomologist at the new zealand research institute scion , told smithsonian . thus large scale adoption of white lighting is likely to increase the impacts of nighttime lighting on all species sensitive to blue light . the tests showed that simply changing the spectrum of leds did not reduce their attractiveness to insects . the use of led lighting is set to increase . estimates suggest the technology , used in everything from homes to billboards today , will be worth £50 billion $80 billion in 2020 . the research , by new zealand based institute scion , found traps placed near leds captured 48 per cent more insects than traps near sodium vapour lights a major concern is that led lights near ports could attract flying pests , such as the gypsy moth , that are accidentally transported by ships .:==:led bulbs use around 90 per cent less energy than incandescent lights . but insects are more strongly attracted to the led spectrum of light . scientists caught and labelled around 20,000 insects attracted to leds . the attraction can be fatal , causing more flies to be eaten by predators . scientists say this can disrupt food chains and damage local ecosystems . another concern is that led lights near ports could attract flying pests , such as the gypsy moth , that are accidentally transported by ships .

complete and consists of more than 190,000 individual blocks . it is on display at sydney university s nicholson museum it was constructed by ryan mcnaught , also known as the brickman , and is on display at sydney university s nicholson museum . the museum said the reconstruction is the largest model of the ancient city ever made out of lego blocks . it shows how the town would have looked at the moment of destruction in 79 ad , how it looked when it was rediscovered in the 1700 s , and how it looks today . since 2012 , the museum has commissioned mr mcnaught to recreate three ancient sites , including a replica of the colosseum in rome and the lego acropolis . the study of the cities of vesuvius is central to the higher school certificate ancient history syllabus at the university . it was built by ryan mcnaught , known as the brickman , and shows how the town would have looked at the moment of destruction in 79 ad , how it looked when it was rediscovered in the 1700 s , and today the forum of pompeii recreated in lego is pictured . it also shows features of the ancient city such as bakeries and bars , temples and marketplaces . the legacy of pompeii in popular culture is

volcanic eruption from nearby mount vesuvius in 79 ad . reports claim that two thousand people died , and the location was abandoned until it was rediscovered in 1748 . many of the buildings , artefacts and skeletons were found intact under a layer of debris . it is now classified as a unesco world heritage site and more than 2.5 million tourists visit each year . in november , french and italian archaeologists excavating areas of the ancient town found raw clay vases that appear to have been dropped by roman potters fleeing the disaster . the city also forms the basis of undergraduate courses on roman history . the university said the lego model helps introduce students to issues of roman daily life , architecture and the history of the excavations . visitors and students can also explore lego features of the ancient city such as bakeries and bars , temples and marketplaces . the legacy of pompeii in popular culture is additionally shown , taken from bulwer lytton s novel the last days of pompeii to more recent hollywood movies , such as pompeii released in 2014 . the use of a popular medium such as lego enabled the museum to present the ancient world in a way that captures new audiences who may not necessarily be museum goers and ensure that fun is a central component of the museum visit , said craig barker , education manager at sydney university museums .

artefacts from the ancient pompeii site for decades , have now begun returning their stolen wares to the museum . in october , a 70 year old woman returned an ancient decoration that she took from the attraction back in 1964 and local archaeologists claim this is a common occurrence . the unnamed woman picked up the small decoration during her honeymoon , and it is said to have formed part of the entrance to a theatre . director massimo osanna told il messaggero : we have been receiving hundreds of packages with hundreds of fragments now for years . stolen artefacts taken from pompeii ruins that have since been returned include tiles , painted plaster , stones and bricks . a local archaeologist said the site has been receiving hundreds of packages with hundreds of fragments for years .

what happens when the winter olympics party leaves town ? it is a question that is probably giving organizers of the sochi 2014 games sleepless nights and , if the example of lillehammer is anything to go by , some food for thought . will all the expense be worthwhile ? russia is spending an unprecedented $50 billion on completely revamping its faded black sea resort , hoping to turn it into a tourist mecca and hi tech business destination for decades after next february 's 16 days of competition . can vladimir putin 's grand planners learn from one of the smallest host venues in olympic history ? leap of faith as stein gruben prepared to make the historic leap at the opening ceremony of the 1994 winter games , he carried with him not just the symbolic torch but also the hopes of the norwegian nation . he was drafted in 48 hours earlier after ole gunnar fidjestol was injured during practice , and his ski jump was to be the dramatic denouement to the olympic flame 's 7,500 mile journey from greece . following the theft of edvard munch 's the scream from norway 's national gallery in oslo earlier that february day , lillehammer 's organizers could have been forgiven for wearing their own looks of anguished despair as gruben started his descent . but they need not have worried . the 26 year old understudy landed safely in the lysgardsbakkene ski jumping arena before handing on the torch on for its final earthbound journey to the olympic cauldron . while lillehammer 94 is perhaps best known for the sad soap opera that played out between u.s. figure skaters tonya harding and nancy kerrigan , norwegians remember a far happier time , when a small town of 23,500 residents became the center of the sporting universe . party atmosphere it was a party for the norwegian people , recalls inge andersen , secretary general of the norwegian olympic committee . it brought people together , there was a lot of pride and there was also lovely winter conditions . so it was , in one way , a great promotion for the country . everyone was happy . this celebratory atmosphere helped push the country 's athletes to new heights . speed skater johann olav koss led the way with three golds and three world records as norway bagged a record 26 medals 10 gold , 11 silver , five bronze . but six years earlier , the idea of lillehammer playing host to such scenes was almost impossible to imagine . norway had endured its worst winter games for more than three decades at calgary in 1988 , picking up just three silver and two bronze . and after finishing fourth in the bid to host the 1992 games won by albertville , france , lillehammer was considered a rank outsider in the race to host the 94 games the first time winter and summer olympics were held in different years . but to everyone 's amazement , lillehammer beat sweden 's ostersund population 60,000 in the final round of voting , setting in motion the task of turning a remote town 110 miles north of oslo into a center of sporting excellence . there was really nothing there , andersen told cnn . there were no big venues before the olympics . it was a huge gift to this part of norway . around 680 million norwegian krone $220 million of the 12 billion nok $2 billion total budget was spent transforming the lillehammer landscape . new venues were built for ski jumping , ice hockey , bobsleigh luge along with freestyle and cross country ski stadiums . additional arenas were sited in neighboring towns hamar and gjovik and two new ski resorts were built north of the lillehammer in kvitfjell and hajfell . lillehammer is now the natural choice for top athletes and national teams . it has probably become the strongest sports region in the country , says andersen . the 16 day event is also remembered as the first green games , enshrining the now familiar ethos of conservation and sustainability at big sporting events . perhaps the most visible and enduring reminder were the olympic medals themselves , which were partly made from stone extracted during construction of the ski jumping arena . a different type of recycling was used when the 26,500 mâ² international media center was refurbished and handed over to lillehammer university college in 1995 . today , the campus has more than 4,000 students and , since 1997 , has been home to the norwegian film school . olympic tourist trap while an educational legacy may be secure , the economic aspirations of boosting tourism in the region proved harder to realize . part of the idea of staging the olympics in lillehammer was to provide investment in inland norway , andersen says , bringing it up to a level with the successful oil and fish industries on the west coast and in the north of the country . it worked in as much that it encouraged and still does affluent city dwellers in oslo and other southern cities to build luxury second homes near the sports facilities . but the goal of encouraging more norwegians and foreign tourists to the wider region have largely failed , says jon teigland , a norwegian social scientist who has studied the economic after effects of the lillehammer olympics . the predictions on a regional level was that tourist demand would increase more than 100 . local scientists predicted annual increases of 15 over a long period . the reality is zero outside all four communities that got winter olympic sports facilities , says teigland . norway did experience a rise in foreign tourists before the olympics and for two years after , says teigland , but this was largely down to increased numbers from eastern europe particularly germans following the fall of communism in 1989 and subsequent years . but long term predictions 10 per year for the decade after the games for tourist growth nationally never happened . lillehammer and the other olympic resorts did not emerge completely u.s.athed . in the five years following the games , 40 of the town 's hotels went bankrupt , says teigland . and while cross country events are incredibly popular , the alpine resorts of hafjell and kvitfjell north of lillehammer remain economically fragile , he says . norway 's experience is not unique . most , if not all of the last eight host countries of winter games have experienced negligible increases in tourist numbers , says teigland . it is something that organizers of the next small town olympics at pyeongchang , south korea in 2018 should bear in mind . they should be very careful about developing a lot of accommodation facilities if they have not seen strong growth in winter sports already , teigland says . the $50 billion question ? of course , before pyeongchang comes sochi 2014 . russia 's great winter sports showpiece will be the most expensive olympics winter or summer in history and five times more expensive than its original budget . lillehammer also overshot its original costs by a similar multiple . it is hard to see how hosting an olympics can ever add up financially , but it appears you cannot put a price on the experience of hosting . lillehammer was well organized . it really was a huge party . was it worth $2 billion or not ? it seems like a lot of norwegians think that it was , teigland says . andersen agrees . here in norway , i have never heard people say it was not worth it , he said . everything in lillehammer got a lift . it was not just an investment in the sports venues , it was an investment in the town itself and also the rail and road links from oslo . norwegians have much to cheer about when it comes to medals too . since 1994 , the homeland of sondre norheim the man who invented recreational skiing in the 19 th century has collected a further 92 winter olympics medals including 34 gold , and finished top of the table at salt lake city in 2002 with 13 golds and 25 in total . thanks to the netflix series lilyhammer , tv viewers worldwide are getting to know the town all over again and in a little over two years , lillehammer will welcome back a new generation of athletes for the 2016 winter youth olympics . we are building a new knowledge for young leaders and coaches here in norway , andersen says . i believe that will be our big gift for the next generation .:==:small norwegian town rose to sporting prominence at 1994 winter olympics . investment in lillehammer has made it a post olympic center of sporting excellence .$1.2 billion of public money gave boost to town but did not increase tourism as expected . lillehammer set to host second winter youth olympics in 2016 .

if you are looking for love and not having much luck , maybe you could increase your success by getting a bit more passionate about helping others . dave chung and kim benty share a love of volunteer work in new orleans . when singles write to advice columnists complaining about being lonely , they are often urged to volunteer . duane bates , the public relations director for habitat for humanity , says it is not unusual for their volunteers to meet on a building site and end up together . victor fasolino was living in new jersey and his future wife , lora , was living in seattle , washington , when the two met in hungary in 1996 while volunteering on a jimmy carter work project for habitat . i thought she was an attractive young lady , recalls victor fasolino , adding that they were working 10 to 12 hour days so it was not until the project was almost complete that they got to spend much time together . both were committed volunteers and had signed up for a habitat fundraising bike ride of 500 miles two weeks after they returned to the united states . they got to know each other while pedaling from kentucky to atlanta , georgia . the two got married one year later atop a house they helped build during another project in pikesville , kentucky . other volunteers had cleaned and scraped a ladder so the bride would not get her wedding gown dirty climbing to the roof . the groom wore a tuxedo , a local minister officiated and a fiddler joined them on the roof to provide the music . this year , victor , 56 , and lora fasolino , 46 , will again work on former president carter 's 2009 habitat work project , building houses in five countries : vietnam , cambodia , thailand , laos and china along the mekong river in southeast asia . in 2007 , dave chung and kim benty found each other while helping hurricane katrina victims in new orleans , louisiana . chung had been a pro golfer playing mini tours in california and living half the year in toronto , ontario , when he got the urge to drive down to new orleans to volunteer . i really liked the place , and the people , says chung . the original plan was to come down here for two months and go to a friend 's wedding , but i ended up staying . at first the 30 something golfer worked for habitat for humanity , learning plumbing and wiring . then he went to work with liz mccartney , 2008 cnn hero of the year , at the st bernard project . meanwhile , kim benty , 36 , an interpreter for the deaf in the western new york town of batavia , began a series of trips in july 2007 to work with volunteers in the same area . benty was smitten after meeting chung on her first trip , but he merely smiled and went back to work . he was doing a little of everything , a runner , bringing supplies , our construction manager , benty remembers . i thought , you know , i am just another volunteer to him . there were several more trips , a few chance meetings but no sparks . but something changed when they met yet again in december 2008 at a friend 's christmas party . we just hit it off that night , chung says . chung says he was attracted to her for a million little reasons : she is attractive , fun to be around and both of us are kind of easygoing . but then it was time for benty to go back to new york and for chung to make the long drive to canada to see his relatives . chung 's new year 's eve plans fell though , so he asked benty about coming down . they hung out for a few days and chung was set to drive by himself back to new orleans . she hopped in the car with me , and came down . it really surprised the people who knew her , chung says , because she is the kind of person who likes to plan everything . ha , it did surprise people , benty admits . i am very conservative , a planner , it was out of context for me they both admit they are at a crossroads of sorts . psychologist diana kirschner , author of the book , love in 90 days , says the couple 's relationship could go either way . i ve seen couples come together in some kind of mission or some kind of movement , and they work together really well when they are within the mission . there is a sense of a bond because of their joint commitment to the mission , says kirschner . but then when the mission ends , or if it ends , they just look at each other and find they have nothing in common . however , i ve also seen it where couples come together like this and basically decide to stay on the mission the rest of their lives . and they marry and they stay on the mission . their marriage is all about being together and helping each other fulfill their purpose in this mission , kirschner says . that is what happened to carol and john coonrod , who met in 1985 while working for several weeks in washington on a book promotion for the the hunger project , an organization dedicated to ending hunger and poverty in the world . the last night when we all went out for a drink , we kind of looked at each other and noticed who we would been working with all that time and we have been together ever since , said carol coonrod , 62 , adding that her husband , 57 , always says , we are living happily ever after . the couple , who have no children , are both on staff at the organization . we have had a relationship that was formed within the hunger project and that has always been our senior mission , part of a senior commitment , said carol coonrod . and within that we have created a partnership and a marriage . their shared passion for their work has driven them during their more than two decade marriage . as we have gotten older , we have sort of rediscovered the rest of life and we have continued to be partners , not only in work , but also in our leisure and the rest of our life . we are wonderfully compatible and enjoy vacation and nonwork time as much as working together , says the veteran volunteer . the younger volunteer couple is still pondering their relationship . we are not trying to put pressure on ourselves , we are trying to have a good time , chung says . but they are certain about one thing . our passion is to be down here with the st bernard project , says benty . you know ,

former dutch football star edgar davids has called on authorities to take a stronger stance against racism . davids , who has been embroiled in a racism row with his country 's soccer icon johan cruyff , told cnn that the problem is not being addressed despite all the recent publicity surrounding controversial remarks made by fifa president sepp blatter . world football 's leader was forced to backtrack after saying in an interview with cnn that there was no racism on the pitch and that any problems could be resolved with a handshake after the match . the suriname born davids , who won 74 caps for the netherlands , is unhappy with remarks the 64 year old cruyff made to him during a supervisory board meeting at dutch club ajax . blatter : racism row is closed there is a line , and if you have a racist comment somebody has to act upon it the person who did it has to be punished and later be educated off the pitch , the 38 year old said on world sport on thursday . what blatter said was inexcusable , but he apologized . something like that also happened in holland when johan cruyff made a racist comment . he did it but he did not apologize . the dutch press let it slide a little bit , and that is what you have to condemn . when someone makes a racist remark that does not make him a racist , but you have to say , this the line , you have crossed it and you have to apologize not only to the person who has been hurt but also the people who live with that racial abuse almost all their lives . i think that is unacceptable if you do not . how should football tackle racism ? football 's authorities have yet to dish out major penalties for racist offenses , with bulgaria 's football association escaping with a â‚¬40,000 $53,000 fine after the country 's fans racially abused england players in september . and blatter 's comments have not had the impact worldwide they had in britain , where the media quickly jumped onto the 75 year old 's remarks . you have to condemn those things , you have to act hard and really address the problem . i think that is lacking a bit , said 1995 champions league winner davids , who played for ac milan , inter milan , barcelona , ajax and tottenham during his illustrious career .:==:edgar davids says the problem of racism in football is not being addressed . the former ac milan star has been involved in a war of words with johan cruyff . davids tells cnn that action must be taken when racist abuse occurs . he says the dutch press have let slide cruyff 's comments at a board meeting .

nigel farage yesterday floated the idea of conservative candidates standing on a joint tory ukip ticket at next year s general election . he suggested that there are some tory eurosceptics who would be open to the idea because they support a euro referendum and wish to avoid splitting the centre right vote in 2015 . standing for two parties at once was authorised for the first time under a change to the law quietly pushed through early last year . nigel farage yesterday floated the idea of conservative candidates standing on a joint tory ukip ticket at next year 's general election . nadine dorries was the first mp to go public and say she would consider it at the time , it was speculated that mps might want to stand for the conservatives and liberal democrats under a joint coalition ticket . but this was dismissed by both parties , and the idea is now being invoked by ukip as a way to stand jointly with mps of any party who want to leave europe . eurosceptic mid bedfordshire mp nadine dorries was the first to go public and say she would consider standing on a joint ukip tory ticket at the next election . the law – the electoral registration and administration act 2013 allows candidates to stand jointly for two parties with a single logo on the ballot paper . it was enacted , the government claimed at the time , to allow labour mps who are also members of the co operative party to use either the labour logo or the specially created labour co op logo , as under the old rules they could not use either . some tories were suspicious it was an attempt to allow coalition ministers to stand for both parties – an idea which now seems highly unlikely . any mp seeking a joint ticket would need the blessing of their party . a tory party source said : there is absolutely no question of anyone standing on a joint ticket with ukip . we wouldn t allow it .:==:ukip figurehead says some tories are keen to avoid splitting the vote in 2015 . but a conservative source said : we would not allow it .

three weeks ago peter bowles went with his wife susan to visit the battle sites of world war i not because of the centenary , but because i m getting old and because i ve always been aware of the tremendous loss of life and personal sacrifice . peter was so disturbed by the sheer horror of it all they cut short the trip . we went to passchendaele where there are 42,000 gravestones and at least a third of them say : known only to god . we d gone with a terrific lecturer who was a professor of history and an ex gurkha . peter bowles at his home in barnes , london , is preparing to star in a new play at the edinburgh fringe festival he said : see these fields ? in three days 85,000 men died capturing that hill . a quarter of a million were wounded . they ve only found 42,000 under the ground we re walking on because the mud was so deep , so there are thousands and thousands of skeletons here still . a few days later the germans came back and took the hill again . so there was such an incredible loss of life for what ? it was so disturbing . this is a very different , reflective peter to the actor who s brought so much laughter into our lives through tv comedy classics to the manor born , perfect scoundrels and the bounder . but peter has extraordinary depth . next week he takes up a guest role at the edinburgh fringe in malcolm mckay s forgotten voices , based upon the book forgotten voices of the great war by max arthur . taken from the imperial war museum s recorded testimonies of the veterans of world war i , it is a series of vividly moving accounts of battle and its terrible aftermath . the play has already opened to rave reviews with julian sands and robert vaughan in the guest role . peter will be followed by the likes of christopher timothy and robert powell . it s such a privilege to be able to express some of the things that happen to men in war , he says . his home in barnes , south west london is lined with books — an early obsession . by the age of seven he had devoured the novels of dickens , and reading aloud to his primary school class led him into acting . after leaving grammar school at 16 , peter won a scholarship to rada , where his contemporaries included richard briers , alan bates , peter o toole , roy kinnear and albert finney . only finney remains . o toole died shortly before christmas aged 81 . last year , peter was

cambridgeshire , where his father worked for the earl of sandwich . my father taught the aga khan , who was a friend of the family , how to ride a bicycle . when the war came , peter s father went to work in a rolls royce engine factory in nottingham . the family moved to a sort of coronation street two up , two down , no bathroom and an outside lavatory where all the ladies left the doors open to talk to each other sitting on the loo . inside the house my parents practised the sort of manners where if a lady came into the room , you d stand up outside in the street it was the rough and tumble of real working class . i still go back sometimes and wander up and down the streets . at rada , his nottinghamshire accent was knocked out of him . when i came out , i didn t know who i was , he says . that , if anything , hampered my acting . my parents saved up for a burton suit when i was 17 . i wore it for interviews . most actors dressed as if they worked in a factory , in donkey jackets and caps . and there was me , a working class person , with this learnt accent and a suit . the director lindsay anderson said : “oh , peter bowles can t act because i saw him in a suit .” funnily enough , not long ago , i went up for a part of a major general in the indian mutiny . i d put on a suit and stood in front of these americans who laughed . they said : we ve never seen an actor in a suit before . so i dropped my trousers and said : “i ll read for you like this if it makes you happier . the young peter would never have had such chutzpah . in fact , it wasn t until he was 50 that he finally knew who he was . he was appearing in the entertainer when its playwright , john osborne , threw down the gauntlet one matinee . he said : “i want to see acting that i haven t seen in the british theatre for 25 years .” he came to the dressing room later , threw his arms around me and said : you ve done it i realised the most important thing for an actor is not talent , it s confidence . at 13 , you are going to live for ever . that s why those boys going to war at 17 or 18 went over the top : they didn t understand their own mortality . when you get older , you do , and you think :

space is a mysterious place and could contain unknown massive structures that act like giant vacuum cleaners that suck galaxies towards them and tilt our universe , according to one expert . he points out that cocooned on our relatively comfortable planet , humans tend to think that we have quite a good notion of the laws of the universe . he claims that we believe we live on a small planet orbiting the sun on the fringes of the milky way galaxy , which space enthusiast david glenn dubs a thoroughly unremarkable galaxy in an infinite universe . space is a mysterious place and could contain unknown massive structures that act like giant vacuum cleaners , titling our universe , according to space expert david glenn . pictured is a black hole , which is a region of spacetime from which gravity prevents anything , including light , from escaping according to glenn , most us us think the laws of physics do not change across the universe , even if what we are examining is billions of light years away . this theory is called the copernican principle , upon which experts base most of their scientific knowledge about the universe . but , glenn said it could be very wrong . scientists have started to look more carefully at the structure of the universe by analysing light from distant galaxies to look at the speed and direction of moving objects like planets and stars . they have observed that rather than moving apart as expected , some distant clusters of galaxies actually appear to be caught in a space current , much like a river . scientists have started to look more carefully at the structure of the universe by analysing light from galaxies such as barnard 's . they have observed that rather than moving apart as expected , some distant clusters of galaxies actually appear to be caught in a space current , much like a river and they are moving at incredibly fast velocities or around two million miles an hour , along a certain path . scientists are u.s.re why but have labeled the phenomenon wouldark flow . to work out why this must be happening , glenn said scientists believe there must be something huge out there . it would have to be so large that it is bigger than anything scientists have seen in the known universe before . glenn added that it could be so massive it could dwarf galactic clusters , which could be drawn towards it as if the huge object were a giant space vacuum cleaner . scientists thinks that this mysterious massive body is so large that is possibly titling our universe . scientists are u.s.re why galaxies are traveling in unusual directions but have labeled the phenomenon wouldark flow . it is a good job there is not a giant unknown object close to the milky way or our neighbouring andromeda galaxy or life as we know it would be changed but it is currently impossible to explore the theory , according to glenn , because scientists have no technology capable of seeing massive structures outside our observable universe , which has a radius of around 45.7 billion light years . he highlights the incredible idea that while the universe has existed for 14 billion years , light from beyond the known universe has not had enough time to reach our telescopes . some scientists have reportedly tried to explain this phenomenon by suggesting that a neighbouring universe could be causing the incredible pull and tilt . while it might take several lifetimes for scientists to develop the technology necessary to identify what these massive objects are , they currently have the power to make experts question the principle of universal uniformity , glenn said .:==:expert claims that space could contain unknown massive structures that act like giant vacuum cleaners , titling our universe . the mysterious structures are leading scientists to question the theory of universal uniformity , according to david glenn . it is impossible to explore the theory as we have no technology that is capable of seeing it outside our observable universe .

the owner of the ski resort in kazakhstan where prince harry and cressida bonas went on holiday is a wealthy oligarch with ties to the dictatorship 's political elite . the shymbulak resort where the young royal and his girlfriend were spotted recently is part owned by serzhan zhumashov , whose construction firm is the leading builder of luxury property in kazakhstan . the oligarch has admitted that he has partly prospered thanks to his political connections saying that he operates in the grey area between the country 's private and public sectors . he has used his estimated £130 million wealth to build links with the west including opening a kazakh offshoot of a leading english public school . resort : the ski destination of shymbulak is part owned by kazakh oligarch serzhan zhumashov kazakhstan has been led by president nursultan nazarbayev an autocratic leader who has suppressed political opposition ever since becoming independent from the u.s. in 1991 . mr nazarbayev has been accused of human rights abuses including censorship and even torture but he controversially hired tony blair as an adviser on a contract reportedly worth £8 million . mr zhumashov , believed to be 47 , joined the country 's finance ministry as soon as he left university , according to u.s. diplomats . in 1996 he went on to found capital partners , the construction company of which he remains chairman , and built up strong links with leading firms in the west . couple : prince harry and cressida bonas , pictured skiing last year , recently visited the kazakh resort project : mr zhumashov built the resort in the mountains above almaty , kazakhstan 's largest city among the projects masterminded by mr zhumashov 's firm have been cinemas , fitness clubs and restaurant chains such as pizzerias , sushi bars and american style diners . his businesses have helped meet the growing demand for a western lifestyle in the ex soviet state where gdp per head is still below $10,000 £6,000 . however , capital partners plans to build further ski resorts after the success of shymbulak have attracted opposition from campaigners who claim they could prove an ecological disaster . mr zhumashov 's most recent major project was the construction of the ritz carlton hotel in almaty , the biggest city in kazakhstan . the five star hotel which calls itself the first true luxury location in kazakhstan is located at the top of almaty 's tallest skyscraper , and prices for its rooms start at around £200 per night . school : the businessman teamed up with haileybury college in hertfordshire , pictured , to found a new private school in kazakhstan the oligarch told u.s. diplomats that capital partners relies on the grey area where private investment and the government intersect , according to a 2008 document released by wikileaks . this suggests that mr zhumashov is close to the nazarbayev regime , although he has also spoken out against the government at times . while most of his business investments have been in his native country , mr zhumashov has also bought property in the west in 2010 , he sold an apartment in manhattan for $3 million £2 million . he sent his son to haileybury college in hertfordshire , the £30,000 a year boarding school attended by film director christopher nolan and former prime minister clement attlee . mr zhumashov helped haileybury set up a pair of sister schools in kazakshstan , haileybury almaty and haileybury astana , at a cost of at least $100 million £60 million . when haileybury almaty first opened in 2008 , mr zhumashov said : we decided to do it so our children could stay here and at the same time get the education that would allow them to enter any university . he has expressed ambitions to team up with ivy league universities in order to set up a business school and medical school in kazakhstan .:==:prince and his girlfriend were seen at the shymbulak resort in kazakhstan . it is part owned by leading property magnate serzhan zhumashov , 47 . he says he operates in the grey area between the public and private sectors and has built luxury restaurants , hotels and cinemas . zhumashov helped set up kazakh spin off of prestigious haileybury college . kazakhstan is a secretive dictatorship accused of human rights abuses .
