it was on the first tuesday in december , 1957 , that little maria ridulph disappeared after taking a piggy back ride from a stranger . her disappearance from a small town in the rich farmlands of illinois shocked america : it seemed she had vanished into thin air in the safest corner of the united states . all that was known was that she had been seen taking a piggyback ride from a strange man near her home a man her friend said was called johnny . long months followed until the seven year old 's body was found in a field the following spring . it was worse than could have been expected : she had been choked with a wire and stabbed . her family hoped that the killer would be brought to justice quickly but in the end they had to wait an astonishing 55 years for justice . the coldest case in us history was finally closed in 2012 when maria 's killer was convicted using a deathbed confession by his mother that had re opened the investigation . vanished : maria ridulph was just seven when she disappeared from the small community of sycamore , illinois , in a crime which shocked 1950 s america . her family had to wait from 1957 until 2012 to see the case closed convicted : jack mccullough left as a teenager was 73 right in a police mugshot when he was jailed for the murder of maria ridulph 55 years previously . he went on to become a washington state policeman family : jack mccullough with his mother , eileen , growing up in sycamore , illinois . her deathbed confession that she provided a false alibi for her son now a new documentary is telling the incredible story of how jack mccullough was finally caught in a case that was so shocking it attracted the attention of former fbi director j edgar hoover . footsteps in the snow , based on a book of the same name , will be shown tonight on the lifetime movie network . it stitches together the events that took place in sycamore , illinois , a tiny farming community of 7,000 people that would never be the same again after families and friends turned against each other in the hunt for the killer . the documentary features interviews with , among others , mccullough , who speaks from the prison in illinois where he will likely die . the book 's author charles lachman told mailonline that there was nothing like the case in american history . he said : it s an epic story of crime and family that spans five decades . what is extraordinary is how this single event changed so many years so many years later . people alive in sycamore , illinois in 1957 remember the night maria was kidnapped the way the rest of us remember where we were on 911 , or , for an older generation , the kennedy assassination . it is with you forever . beyond that , the case made legal history . never before had a criminal case from such a distant past ever been brought to justice in a criminal court in america . lachman , who is also executive producer of inside edition , added that the case was so compelling because it opened the door to sycamore 's dark past . he said : sycamore was the quintessential small town – a great place to grow up and raise a family . but there were all these secrets . reconstruction : a picture from the time shows how frighteningly close maria ridulph 's abduction was to her front door happy child : maria ridulph at a birthday celebration before she vanished from sycamore , illinois , in 1957 picket fence childhood : sycamore , illinois seemed like the epitome of small town america in the 1950 s until its security was shattered by maria ridulph 's disappearance and murder loved : little maria was from a happy family who were utterly shocked at her disappearance . the whole community of sycamore felt haunted by the case last resting place : maria 's family buried her in sycamore , where her murderer was sentenced to life in prison in 2012 , 55 years after she was murdered relief : kathy chapman and mary hunt after the conviction of jack mccullough in 2012 for the murder of maria ridulph . hunt is the murdered girl 's half sister while chapman was her childhood friend and with her until minutes before she was absucted maria was a brown eyed second grader when she disappeared from the corner of archie place and center cross street in sycamore on the evening of december 3 , 1957 . she had just taken a piggy back ride with a man who introduced himself as johnny and then took away to her doom . it was crime that shocked america and then president dwight d eisenhower reportedly asked for regular updates on the case . maria 's mother frances and father michael pleaded on tv for her to come home but the following april her body was discovered 120 miles away by a grove of trees , and a homicide inquiry was begun . seventeen year old mccullough , who was known then as john tessier , was given an alibi by his parents who told investigators he was in the city of rockford 40 miles away . he also passed an fbi polygraph and told agents he would been traveling to chicago for a medical exam before joining the air force . the inquiry looked at 100 persons of interest but nobody was arrested and nobody was brought to justice . years passed and maria 's parents would endured unimaginable agony until 1994 when mccullough 's mother eileen tessier died and told her daughters that she lied to give her son an alibi 36 years earlier . another 14 years passed until 2008 when the illinois state police finally reopened the case at the request of mccullough 's half sister janet tessier . when mccullough was arrested he was living in seattle and was working as a security guard under a different name . during his lifetime he also been in the air force , the army and worked as a washington state police officer . in 2012 maria 's body was exhumed and his trial went ahead , heavily relying on witnesses who tried their best to recall events more than half a century old . long road : pat quinn and charles ridulph , the brother and sister of maria , who had waited 55 years for their sibling 's murderer , mccullough , to be brought to justice and said : now maria is at peace . serviceman : mccullough served in the air force and army and went on to be a washington state policeman . he was 18 and an airman when he killed maria family photo : mccullough sent this image of him in uniform to a family member . it was almost certainly taken after he murdered maria ridulph . portrait of a killer : mccullough was painted nude in the 1980 s for this image , around 30 years after he murdered the seven year old maria ridulph the key testimony came from kathy chapman , a childhood friend of maria 's who was with her until moments before she disappeared . she was shown an old photograph of mccullough and identified him as johnny . she recalled how she ran up and down the snow covered street before dashing home to tell her family : maria s lost i cannot find maria now 63 , chapman was just eight at the time it happened . tessier also told the court about her mother 's confession and after mccullough refused to give evidence he was found guilty . before the sentencing prosecutor , victor escarcida said that mccullough had left a lifetime of emotional wreckage in his wake . he said : jack mccullough made sycamore a scary place . now there was a true boogeyman living among them . he is the definition of evil . maria 's parents were not there to see the verdict as they had died in the 1990 s . but speaking after the hearing , maria 's older brother charles ridulph said he was satisfied with the sentence . he said : this is all we could expect . now maria is finally at peace . the conviction also gave observers a chance to look again at the missed chances to prosecute mccullough which could have brought about justice sooner . lachman told mailonline that the case took so long to come to court because it was a mess from the beginning . he said : the original investigation was afflicted by police dysfunction and incompetence . there were issues of jurisdiction . who was in charge ? the fbi ? the state police . the local authorities ? everybody found it hard to believe that the crime could have been committed by a local boy . interest : j edgar hoover , then director of the fbi , and president dwight d eisenhower were both reportedly updated on the case of the missing seven year old , reflecting the shock felt in 1950 s america at the crime widely reported : the story was headline news not just in dekalb county , illinois , but across the country earlier this year mccullough , now 74 , filed an 80 page appeal saying there was no forensic evidence tying him to the crime . he says that since it happened so long ago there was no way the witnesses could remember what they saw . the appeal states : the evidence against jack mccullough , was so unreasonable , so improbable , and so u.s.tisfactory as to create a reasonable doubt that he was responsible for a 1957 murder , kidnapping , and abduction of an infant . the hearing will be held on december 3 with deep irony , 57 years to the day since maria went missing .:==:maria ridulph vanished into thin air in small town sycamore , illinois , in december 1957 . she disappeared moments after she had been with a friend and yards from home . fbi boss j edgar hoover and president eisenhower were informed about case which shocked america . her body was found the following spring , choked and stabbed , but police could not find killer . suspect johnny mccullough 's mother confessed on her deathbed that she had lied about an alibi . victim 's sister persuaded police to open case and in 2012 mccullough a former airman , soldier and policeman was convicted . new documentary and book reveal truth about case and comes as mccullough , 74 , plans appeal against conviction .

in a room which once served as the residence of the painter monet at london 's savoy hotel , one of rock 's most engaging and enduring entertainers is having a little trouble recovering his hearing . visibly though , iggy pop shows no after effects from last night 's gig at the city 's festival hall . at 66 he looks in great shape yet a glance at his hell raising musical resume tells you it is a wonder he is here at all . the early reviews of the show at london 's meltdown festival curated this year by yoko ono speak of his boundless , youthful energy as he bounds on to the stage like a jack in the box who is just escaped the confines of the toy cupboard , cajoling , teasing and captivating his audience with the skills of the consummate showman . there is a lot of craft , he says . everything from learning the different parts of the room to reading the reactions to ultimately . you are like a funnel or a vacuum cleaner . you are a transformer between all the energy of the group and its music and the different energies of all the people in the different parts of the room . what is really happening when it is good is that everybody 's flowing into each other 's presence , maybe through the medium of a particular riff or a particular chorus but also a monkey a well rehearsed monkey , he laughs . read more : foo fighters drummer will play iggy pop pop 's monkey business has revealed itself in various forms of bad behavior on stage over the years . among the less notorious antics , are his trademark topless performance and an affinity to stage dive into his audience . the first time i did it i was 21 years old and i was opening for frank zappa who was great and we were just a local band in a psychedelic bar room , he recalls . in those days , he tells me , they would be lucky to get a sympathy fee of $50 . but we were cute kids and we got to play with everybody and i thought it was my job to make sure that when we played no one forgot about us i did that thing that little kids do when they are not getting enough attention from their parents , they just fall forward and wait for maybe somebody to catch them . and i would just step off the stage and inspect the audience . forty five years later and he is still at it last year i did a couple of big dives and i got a couple of stitches because i always overdo it and at this stage i just fall in once in a while and say hi and it is fine just a gentle collapse is okay but some things have changed since those early days : the after show party today is an altogether calmer affair , in the company of his third wife nina alu , a nice bottle of bordeaux and lots of desserts . and someone will draw my bath and sleep will come hard . there is some element i do with the stooges . the hardcore stuff . it is a bit like being a prize fighter , there is a lot of nervous energy and you wake up sore . pop is currently touring europe with the stooges , having recorded ready to die only their fifth album in 45 years . his parents named him james osterberg junior but playing in a band called the iguanas led to the nickname iggy and an apparent similarity to a local character named pop provided the rest . in the early days , he says , he became known as the man you love to hate and today he is most commonly billed as the godfather of punk a term with which he is uncomfortable . at first it was just a really embarrassing tag and then it got to be funny and then i just gave up i ve been called lots of things and it is nice to have lots of titles . i am waiting for nobel laureate no one 's nominating me so i am putting it out there . pop 's musical career has been supplemented by a long association with movies both as an actor and musician . tracks such as the passenger , lust for life , search and destroy and i want to be your dog have appeared on the soundtracks to almost 150 movies and tv series . this summer he will be played by foo fighters drummer taylor hawkins in the film cbgb , about the legendary new york music club frequented by the likes of the ramones , blondie and patti smith . but an unexpected acting connection revealed itself during pop 's visit to london . harry potter star daniel radcliffe has confessed to being a huge fan of iggy and was reported as saying that playing his idol on screen was his ultimate dream . pop tells me radcliffe attended last night 's gig and the singer seems delighted to be reaching a new generations of fans . i think it would be great if everybody played me , he says . yeah , come on kid play me i think it is wonderful it is a gift that anyone would think of me however there is one actor in particular with whom iggy pop has developed a strong musical bond and friendship although it did not start out that way . johnny depp was in a couple of bands in the florida area i think rocky city angels and the kids and apparently once when i was in my wildest phase i played in gainesville . he came to the club , he tells me he tried to meet me and tell me about his band and i said : shut up you little turd . happily , the relationship survived this first awkward encounter . since then we have played and we have jammed on and off . he is a very sensitive guitarist , he has a really nice intonation , attack and a really nice sense of music . and we recorded one thing together years ago called hollywood affair and we played once on french telly . fans of both depp and pop have a chance to hear their latest collaboration on the soundtrack of depp 's new film the lone ranger depp plays the masked lawman 's native american character tonto with a rendition of the traditional gold rush era song sweet betsy from pike . he called up about this and i think it was late in the game and he did not have a great cut and with about two weeks to go he said : come on , we got to get this together so choose a song . so i tried writing something but it is not my style and sweet betsy is just a great great great song and he plays beautifully on it i just had a great time doing that . with close friends david bowie and lou reed continuing to stir up the music business and contemporaries the rolling stones reaching new musical milestones , pop remains one of rock 's great survivors . what is interesting is that for people of our generation that matured in the 1960 s , people still seem to be interested . i got to think there was some sorta bump in the quality in that period 65 75 . it is pretty much a given that a decent , or better than decent , musician or songwriter is going to keep doing it in some way throughout their life .:==:iggy pop is touring europe with his band the stooges . it follows the completion of only their fifth album in 45 years . early reviews speak of the 65 year old 's boundless energy .

for thousands of years , people have gazed at the night sky and found things they can relate to their lives on earth . where the ancient greeks saw mythological characters in the stars though , today s scientists have spotted something a little less glamorous . astronomers have discovered a molecular cloud , formations in space known as the nursery of an unborn star , which they say looks like a pig s tail . the giant pigs tail cloud spotted 30,000 light years from earth the japanese research team found two giant molecular clouds 30,000 light years from our solar system which they believe collided and formed the peculiar shape . and , spotting the twist in its tail , they gave the gas cloud an equally peculiar name . while the clouds often collide , few have been seen to do so with the spectacular consequences found by shinji matsumura , a second year ph d candidate , and tomoharu oka , an associate professor , the research team from the department of physics at keio university . they said they believe a magnetic tube was formed between the two giant molecular clouds , which is twisted and squeezed to become a helical structure during the frictional contact . their research suggested that the molecular gas is captured by the twisted magnetic tube , forming the distinctive pigtail shape . researchers believe the galaxy was formed between the two giant molecular clouds , which is twisted and squeezed to become a helical structure . our galaxy has a high quantity of the molecular gas which forms stars within a 600 light year radius from its centre . those clouds become increasingly dense and orbit the galaxy s nucleus . at the distance that these two are found , there are two closed elliptical orbits clouds travel along and , at one of the two intersections , molecular clouds often collide . the huge gas formations can eventually give birth to new stars as they become denser . the gas is compressed even more when clouds collide with each other , meaning the strange shape observed by the scientists manning the nro 45 m telescope at the nobeyama radio observatory in the national astronomical observatory of japan – which measures around 60 light years by 60 light years could one day become a star itself . mr matsumura said : in order to solve the mystery of the pigtail molecular cloud , we carried out high resolution spectroscopic observations of rotational spectral lines for six other molecules . those molecules are clues to understanding the physical state . we were amazed by the clear and beautiful helical structure of the pigtail molecular cloud in the data taken by the follow up observation . the data revealed that the pigtail molecular cloud has a huge volume of gas , several hundreds of thousands times greater than the sun has .:==:astronomers believe unique twisting shape was created when two clouds collided . pigtail cloud has a huge volume of gas , several hundreds of thousands times greater than the sun .

the queen is living in crumbling surroundings and faces a £50 million repair bill to bring her palaces up to scratch , it emerged yesterday . more than a third of the royal estate has been designated as below target condition . national treasures such as buckingham palace and windsor castle have walls riddled with asbestos , badly need rewiring and have leaking roofs . the queen pictured in buckingham palace with french president francois hollande staff have to catch the rain in buckets to protect priceless works of art and antiques , particularly in the queen s gallery at buckingham palace . keeper of the privy purse sir alan reid revealed that it will cost tens of millions to return royal residences to their former splendour . details of the queen s penury emerged as her courtiers were accused by mps of dragging their feet over a huge backlog of repairs . sir alan , the royal family s senior treasurer , was questioned by members of the commons public accounts committee after a national audit office report revealed the queen will enjoy a 22 per cent increase in income over two years . she is expected to be given £37.9 million in 201415 to run her household and conduct official engagements , up from £31 million in 201213 . but most of the state rooms used for entertaining foreign heads of state have not been decorated since the queen came to the throne 60 years ago , while princess anne was almost hit by falling masonry as she got out of her car at buckingham palace just a few years ago . it was claimed staff in buckingham palace have resorted to using rain buckets to protect the priceless art hung in the queen 's gallery from the leaking roof keeper of the privy purse sir alan reid revealed that it will cost tens of millions to return royal residences , like buckingham palace , to their former splendour palace officials blame the backlog on a real terms squeeze of up to 60 per cent in funding by government over the past 20 years , forcing them to make do and mend . windsor castle has had its lead roofs patched up so many times that an area the size of both centre and no1 courts at wimbledon needs replacing . mps were shocked at the complacency of the backlog , which means some buildings such as victoria and albert s mausoleum at windsor could be lost to the nation . the ageing royal train is likely to be scrapped in the next five to ten years as the cost of replacing it would be staggering , aides admitted yesterday . despite now being used by the queen , the duke of edinburgh and prince charles barely a dozen times a year – at a cost of more than £25,000 per journey – palace officials have always insisted it was a necessary mode of travel . asked whether it was a sensible option in the future or offered effective value for money , sir alan reid admitted the train , built in the 1970 s , doesn t have much life left in it . he even confessed it was noisy , slow and uncomfortable . they also questioned why the queen s energy bills have soared by 50 per cent in a year to £3.1 million , when money could have been saved if courtiers had had the wit to fix their bills as millions of her subjects do sir alan yesterday blamed the high energy costs in part on antiquated boilers which have not been replaced for 60 years . labour s austin mitchell said : i gather from the report that you ve managed the finances by letting the buildings deteriorate , and freezing staff costs and by digging into the reserves . work is being carried on while they are living in crumbling surroundings . tory richard bacon said he had been told the buckingham palace wiring had not been done since 1949 . everyone knows that the longer you leave something , the worse it gets and the greater the overall cost of maintenance and restoration in the longer term , he said . labour s fiona mactaggart said : i have to say i am rather shocked at the complacency , and what i want to know is what you have done to ensure that these buildings are secure for the nation . sir alan replied : i would love to do the whole of the property backlog right away , but we have limited funds , there s a head of state to support as well as buildings to maintain . we have to make priorities . some of the rooms in buckingham palace and windsor castle have not been decorated for 60 years windsor castle have walls riddled with asbestos , badly need rewiring and have leaking roofs , it was revealed he admitted that some 39 per cent of the royal estate was below target condition . the committee chairman , labour s margaret hodge , was dismayed when sir alan initially said he could not give the precise cost of repairs , a figure he later estimated to be around £50 million . after the hearing , mrs hodge said : they ve got to get a bit real . the rest of the world is coping , why can t they ? i was pretty shocked that they hadn t got a clear view of what work needed to be done , what was the cost and where the priorities lay . you don t run national heritage assets that way , from hand to mouth . they can serve her majesty better . sir alan told the committee they were hoping to make major inroads over the next decade . as well as questioning the big increase in energy bills , mps asked why the royal family s gas use had soared by 14 per cent . sir alan said that while the household did not fix its bill , it set up multi year deals to obtain power from the wholesale markets . last week s nao report highlighted previous significant reductions in the monarchy s funding . in order to cope the queen s money men have reduced net expenditure by 55 per cent in real terms . the queen has repeatedly eaten into her savings – known as drawing down on reserves – over the years and is , apparently , down to her last £1 million in the bank . balmoral castle in aberdeenshire was not mentioned in by sir alan who was questioned by members of the commons public accounts committee .:==:senior royal treasurer revealed buckingham palace and windsor castle are riddled with asbestos and need rewiring . sir alan reid faced questions of the commons public accounts committee . rain buckets used by staff to protect priceless art work in the queen 's gallery from leaking roof . most rooms at buckingham palace have not been decorated for 60 years . the queen will also enjoy 22 per cent rise in income over next two years .

five years ago , on october 3 , 2008 , with the economy in a tailspin , president george w bush signed the $700 billion troubled asset relief program into law , giving the government the ability to bail out the big banks to prevent further calamity . a number of factors caused the economic collapse , but one in particular stands out a witch 's brew of money and politics . as the financial crisis inquiry commission wrote in its 2011 report , it did not surprise the commission that an industry of such wealth and power would exert pressure on policy makers and regulators . from 1999 to 2008 , the financial sector expended $2.7 billion in reported federal lobbying expenses individuals and political action committees in the sector made more than $1 billion in campaign contributions . five years later , with millions of americans still unemployed or underemployed , not much has changed . wall street is still the biggest player in washington . the industry dished out more dough than any other industry during the 2012 election . in the first six months of 2013 , the finance , insurance and real estate sector has already given $63 million to federal candidates and committees . it has spent $242 million on more than 2,000 lobbyists . the dodd frank financial reform was an important legislation and it has , and will continue , to protect consumers from abuses of the banks . but the industry played a major role in what rules were passed and it continues to play a role in the implementation of regulation rules . soon , the supreme court may give bankers and wealthy special interests the same guys and gals who wrecked the economy in 2008 even more influence . on october 8 , the court will hear oral arguments in mccutcheon v fec , a case brought by alabama businessman shaun mccutcheon and the republican national committee that threatens to remove the aggregate limits that individual donors can give , in total , to federal candidates and committees each election cycle . for the 2014 election cycle , that total is $123,200 more than double the median american family income . if the court sides with mccutcheon , an individual donor could bundle more than $1 million to congressional fundraising committees . so what does this have to do with wall street and tarp ? plenty . some 28 of the roughly 1,200 individuals who got within 10 of the aggregate limit in the 2012 election work on wall street . these super donors work at goldman sachs , elliott management and other top financial firms . wall street was the biggest industry to put money into politics . if aggregate limits are thrown out , a future presidential candidate could be allowed to ask for a $2 million donation for his campaign and various committees . congressional leaders could set up a fundraising committee that could take in $3.5 million from one donor . that is a sweet deal for wall street , but it is a raw deal for democracy . based on past precedent , the court should uphold the current limits . but whether the justices do or do not , our democracy is already in trouble . congress must act to raise the voices of we the people . stampstampede . org brings the issue home to main street . the stampede encourages people to legally stamp messages such as not to be used for bribing politicians on our nation 's currency to support reforms to getmoneyout of politics . every bill is seen an average of 875 times and helps demonstrate a growing , sustained demand for reform . one solution is modeled on successful systems in arizona , connecticut and maine , which allow candidates to run competitive campaigns for office by relying on a mix of small donations and limited public funds . there are a handful of similar measures already introduced in congress . they would empower small dollar donors and help them compete with the lobbyists , bankers and wealthy donors writing big checks . the american people want and deserve a representative democracy that represents the people , not super rich donors . but unless we come together and demand change , congress will continue to be owned or at least rented by big money . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of ben cohen and betty ahrens .:==:it is been five years since the government bailed out banks during the economic crisis . ben cohen , betty ahrens : today , wall street is still the biggest player in washington . in upcoming mccutcheon v fec , supreme court may give the rich even more power . cohen , ahrens : we need democracy that represents the people , not super rich donors .

nick clegg last night joined the chorus of demands to strip disgraced banker sir fred goodwin of his knighthood . the deputy prime minister s intervention means all three main party leaders have now backed a review of the honour for the ex royal bank of scotland chief . whitehall s forfeiture committee is to consider whether to ask the queen to revoke sir fred s knighthood , which was bestowed on him in 2004 for services to banking . under fire : calls for sir fred goodwin , seen here with his wife lady joyce , to lose his knighthood have intensified with clegg backing miliband 's opinion the deputy prime minister said : honours should be deserved and awarded to unique people who have made britain a better place . i sympathise with those who think it a travesty for a man who did so much damage to the british economy and made so much money in the process to retain his knighthood . i understand the outrage and there is an independent process that deals with revoking honours – they must be left to make their own decision on this . mr cameron has said the forfeiture committee should take into account a damning report into the collapse of rbs by the financial services authority last month . ed miliband , left , has backed calls for sir fred to have his knighthood removed while david cameron , right , is sympathetic to the calls too and revealed a secret whitehall body is to consider revoking the title it said poor decisions by sir fred were a major factor in the crisis that led to rbs being bailed out with £45 billion of taxpayers money . meanwhile , tory mp matthew hancock has tabled a series of questions over the granting of sir fred s honour . mr hancock is demanding all correspondence between treasury officials , ministers and special advisers relating to the honours list of 2004 . gordon brown , who was chancellor that year , is said to have backed sir fred s award , but it emerged yesterday that the scottish government then led by jack mcconnell , now a labour peer , pushed sir fred s nomination . mr hancock has tabled a commons motion arguing it was perverse and unacceptable that sir fred should keep the knighthood . conservative party chairman baroness warsi and labour s shadow education secretary stephen twigg also backed calls for the knighthood to be forfeited . the treasury , as the department which recommended the rbs chief , pictured in 2009 , for the award in 2004 , is expected to set out reasons for its removal to the forfeiture committee but lord mcconnell insisted sir fred was not the only person to blame for the collapse of rbs . he said : i think the reasons for what happened at the banks are more complex than just one person . fred goodwin made mistakes , but so did a lot of other people at rbs , including people on the board who also have honours . they appointed him and agreed the strategy and have never been held to account . i think the government , both the labour and tory government before it , were making mistakes about regulation . i sympathise with the public concern on this issue but i think if you are going to have a system that is relatively independent and fair in allocating these awards then you need to have a system that is independent and fair in looking at removing them . by alex brummer arrogance : sir fred goodwin who was removed from his job in 2008 the only surprise about the clamour to strip sir fred goodwin of his knighthood is that it has taken so long . it was all the way back in october 2008 , in the tumultuous days following the crash of lehman brothers , that he was unceremoniously removed from his job as chief executive of the royal bank of scotland . rbs had all but collapsed and was nationalised at a cost to taxpayers of £48 billion . but , even in those final hours , he negotiated himself an astonishing pensions package originally worth £16 million , or £693,000 a year for the rest of his life . heading for the lifeboat first , as the ship was listing , was an act of selfishness and hubris seldom matched in british public life . the disaster at rbs immeasurably damaged this nation and all who live in it it has tainted banking and the financial system , one of the great pillars of britain s modern prosperity , and massacred the reputation of all bankers . far more seriously , it has destroyed life savings , and helped condemn the nation to slow growth and surging unemployment . and at the heart of this catastrophe was goodwin , a man who had a swagger and an arrogance unmatched in a financial world not short of egos . his mad drive to turn rbs into the world s largest bank drove him to trample over all those in his way as he indulged in a frenzy of reckless lending . the consequences of his appalling misjudgments are being felt today , and will be for years to come . the bank abandoned all pretence of traditional scottish prudence and lent to anyone who knocked on the door . among those able to borrow money was the ambitious entrepreneur richard kirk , who needed money to buy the high street shopping chain peacock s when rbs pulled the plug on the company this week , 10,000 jobs were placed at risk , adding to the tens of thousands already lost at rbs . goodwin came to believe he was better than anyone else at what he did . there is no greater testimony to his overweening vanity than rbs s monstrous world headquarters , built on a greenfield site at gogarburn on the outskirts of edinburgh . this folly was designed to please the chief executive , and hang the shareholders and customers . secure in his palatial headquarters , he organised his surroundings , including the kitchens , allegedly so that scallops , a favourite dish , could arrive at his desk while at their moist best . there was a private aircraft , rbs1 , a fleet of bmw limousines stamped through with the rbs logo and a suite at the savoy for his london visits . most disgracefully of all , goodwin felt so above the rules that governed the lives of ordinary rbs employees and staff in other large organisations that he felt able to conduct an extramarital affair with a senior female colleague . he then hid behind a court injunction until he was found out . goodwin s willingness to use the law to hide his egregious behaviour has become notorious . when a sunday times diarist reported on the supposed scallops kitchen he sued for libel . more recently , he hired lawyers to sanitise the investigation by the financial services authority into the firm s collapse . as a result , goodwin receives only a handful of mentions in the report . what does come through loud and clear is his hectoring and bullying , which made colleagues too scared to challenge him . at the height of his reign , in the summer of 2008 , after he had wasted £49 billion of shareholders money buying the badly run dutch bank abn amro , i visited him for lunch . when i questioned the wisdom of buying a bank in the middle of a credit meltdown , he forcefully defended his actions . it was ignorant and dangerous bravado . the deal must rank as one of the greatest derelictions of duty by a chief executive in modern times . his knighthood – arranged by gordon brown in 2004 – makes a laughing stock of all those deserving of the honour . it also casts a terrible pall over the honours system and cocks a snook at all those suffering because of goodwin s mistakes . his is a case so exceptional the queen , on the recommendation of government , should not hesitate to remove this blot on the business world . to do so would show the world what moral capitalism actually means , and perhaps even give the banking system the fresh start it craves . by becky barrow and tim shipman defiant : stephen hester who the prime minister said should not receive a penny in bonus david cameron vowed to block a £1 million bonus for the boss of a failed bank rescued by the taxpayer yesterday . the prime minister s war on excessive executive pay comes as critics said royal bank of scotland boss stephen hester should not receive a penny in bonus . mr hester , 51 , is said to be in line to enjoy a £1.5 million windfall despite the fact that the bank s share price has halved over the last year . asked if he would act to stop the bosses of state owned banks receiving £1 million bonuses , mr cameron replied : the short answer is yes . the prime minister announced that the government would cap cash bonuses in the two state owned banks – rbs and lloyds tsb – at £2,000 for all employees and would use its clout as major shareholder to limit the amount in shares paid to senior executives . no 10 sources said the prime minister is determined to act and would assure that there was no repeat of the absurd bonus paid to mr hester last year , which topped £2 million . yesterday experts expressed fury that mr hester could be weeks away from a bonus while the rest of the country suffers an income squeeze . sources say mr hester is adamant he deserves his bonus for his role at the helm of the disgraced bank , which was kept afloat with £45 billion of taxpayers money . but sir philip hampton , chairman of rbs , insisted rumours that a £1.5 million bonus has been agreed are inaccurate and premature . he said : neither the remuneration committee nor the board has discussed the position on the bonus for our chief executive for 2011 at this stage . any suggestion to the contrary is therefore untrue . the timing is particularly awkward because business secretary vince cable will on tuesday reveal his plans for curbing executive pay .:==:ed miliband is also calling for wider reform of the honours system . sir fred was given the award in 2004 for services to banking . he steered rbs to the brink of collapse and left taxpayers with £45 bn bill .

nobody spoke english like sir donald sinden . the actor , who has died aged 90 , was the last and greatest of a generation that sounded every consonant of every word . this theatrical knight confessed that three things made his blood boil : vandalism , litter and the misuse of the english language . it gets me so cross , he would say , the way the ends of words are never pronounced , like “yeah” instead of “yes”. donald sinden , who played chief officer shawe wilson in the captain 's table , died on thursday aged 90 he won fame as a leading man in the golden age of british cinema , as a light comedian , as a shakespearian orator , in tv sitcom and as a west end star his resonant tones made him a booming success in every branch of acting . he won fame as a leading man in the golden age of british cinema , as a light comedian , as a shakespearian orator , in tv sitcom and as a west end star . that fruity — many would say hammy — voice was unmistakable . as malvolio in shakespeare s twelfth night , he delivered the classic line some have greatness thrust upon em , exaggerating every syllable — sommme have grrreat nesss therrrustt upp on emmm but he lacked the obsessive drive of contemporaries such as laurence olivier or dickie attenborough — rather than making epics or winning oscars , sinden preferred to potter around english churches , taking notes on their architecture , or to explore italy by car with his beloved wife , diana . born in 1923 , the son of a chemist in ditchling , in sussex , he suffered from asthma throughout his childhood , and left school at 15 to be apprenticed to a shopfitter . with his wheezy voice , acting had never occurred to him , but at the outbreak of war his cousin , an amateur actor , was called up and donald became his stand in for an am dram production in brighton . to his surprise , he was a natural . he was talent spotted by the director of a wartime entertainment unit , and spent the rest of the war learning joinery in the workshop each day and touring army training camps and anti aircraft batteries each evening . i was either brilliant , or they couldn t find anyone else , he joked . when his own call up papers came , he was ruled medically unfit for duty owing to his asthma . so he entertained the troops — in 1945 , he toured europe and india with ensa , the entertainments national service association also known as every night something awful . then he trained at the webber douglas drama school in london , where voice coaches helped him develop his thundering bass delivery , with syllables that sounded like lumps of falling masonry . he met diana mahony after earning a place at the shakespeare memorial theatre in stratford upon avon as an understudy . diana was playing helen of troy in dr faustus , and ceres in the tempest . she had a line in goddesses that season , sinden said . she was a classical looking lady , statuesque and beautiful . sir donald sinden , pictured outside buckingham palace after receiving his knighthood , had prostate cancer sinden played simon peel , a snooty antiques dealer , in sitution comedy never the twain the first time he proposed , by moonlight on a bridge over the avon , she declined . but he persevered , and they married in 1948 . diana gave up her career to raise their family : they had two children , jeremy and marc , both actors . the devoted couple were together for more than 55 years until diana s death from cancer , aged 77 , in 2004 . while she had been caring for their babies , donald tirelessly made his name as an actor . in a 19 month run during the late forties at the theatre royal haymarket in the heiress , he never missed a show . the management gave him an engraved silver ashtray to mark his achievement of giving more consecutive performances than any other actor in the theatre s history . the ashtray was appropriate — despite his asthma , sinden would for much of his life puff through two or more packs a day . his cinema breakthrough came in 1953 with an adaptation of the cruel sea , nicholas monsarrat s novel about the battle between the navy and german you boats hunting atlantic convoys during world war ii jack hawkins , then the country s biggest star , was the commander of a sub hunter , and newcomer sinden was his brave but inexperienced junior , in a father son relationship that many film buffs believe would have earned them oscars for best actor and best supporting actor , had the movie been made in hollywood . the honours went to on the waterfront with marlon brando , the mumbling , slurring antithesis of everything sinden stood for . his loathing of method acting won sinden an unexpected admirer , marilyn monroe . their dressing rooms at pinewood studios were four doors apart while she was filming the prince and the showgirl , and he another movie , and sinden mocked her attempts at brando style naturalism . he hung a sign on his door advertising his own drama classes , guaranteed to out do the method : you too can be inaudible “u.s. and “ers” rendered obsolete monroe saw the joke and started dropping in , not for acting lessons but to offload her troubles . she popped in for a natter and a giggle , sinden said . of course as a sex symbol she was stunning , but sadly , she must be one of the silliest women i have ever met . accolades were heaped on him for twelfth night and much ado about nothing , in which he acted with judi dench , and for his king lear the cruel sea was followed by another war classic , above us the waves , as well as lighter films , like the captain s table , you know what sailors are and the romantic farce doctor in the house . sinden played tony benskin , the eternal medical student who spends his time boozing and chasing nurses . when he saw a girl he liked , benskin , instead of wolf whistling , would emit a gutteral growl . this sexy but safe persona won him stardom , and he was voted the face british housewives would most like to see across their breakfast tables . but it also prevented him from being taken seriously . when a sex scandal forced britain s highest paid tv star leslie phillips out of his hit itv sitcom , our man at st mark s in 1963 , the lovable but harmless sinden was the obvious choice to take over . he became so disillusioned at the way film producers refused to cast him in serious roles that he quit his contact with rank studios and returned to stratford . under director peter hall he played the duke of york in the wars of the roses , an adaptation of shakespeare s henry vi trilogy , and took the play to the west end . it was a triumph . he followed that with a restoration comedy , the relapse , as the ludicrously camp lord foppington , with rosebud lips and an orange head dress based on wigs worn by female impersonator danny la rue . sir donald sinden died at his home in romney marsh , kent , 10 years after his wife passed away accolades were heaped on him for twelfth night and much ado about nothing , in which he acted with judi dench , and for his king lear . in 1979 he became the last white actor to play othello at stratford with his face blackened . it s a performance i was lucky enough to see : he was heartfelt and tragic as the african general who kills his wife in a jealous rage . but the black and white minstrel s make up , contrasted with the plummy vowels , seemed too dated to be taken seriously . though not yet 60 , sinden sensed that his era in the theatre was passing . he fell back on television , as elaine stritch s butler in two s company and as an antiques dealer in never the twain , which ran for ten years . it became a family affair : sons jeremy and marc played police officers in one episode , while diana was in the final show . his passion for religious architecture led him to present a bbc documentary series in 1988 , the english country church , in which his delivery was so orotund and opulent that he earned his own puppet on spitting image . his character was usually seen pleading for a knighthood the real one arrived in 1997 . and at a restaurant , the sinden puppet summoned a waiter and boomed : do you serve a ham salad ? yes , came the reply — they served salad to anyone . he and diana were devastated by the death of jeremy , aged 45 , from cancer in 1996 . donald continued to work in television , but his great pleasure in later life was to regale friends at the garrick club with theatrical anecdotes — and the printable ones were collected into an everyman book . his voice came to be known as the defining sound of the garrick . it was the sound of a vanished age of english theatre , too . no actor will ever again declaim his lines with such majesty as donald sinden .:==:sir donald sinden died on thursday after a battle with prostate cancer . the 90 year old actor died at his home in kent , his son revealed . shakespearean actor appeared in 70 film and tv projects in his career .

congressional republicans , led by house oversight committee chair darrell issa , are planning another irs coal raking exercise for wednesday , hauling the tax agency 's commissioner in for a hearing about the nearly year old tea party targeting scandal.com mittee staff say the u.s. department of justice and the rest of the obama administration have not shown them any sign that they are investigating corruption in the awarding of income tax exemptions to nonprofit groups . an aide to one republican committee member said monday that the white house and the treasury department were already dangerously close to causing a constitutional crisis . they ve blown off the subpoenas , the aide said , referring to legal demands the committee issued to the irs on august 2 and february 14 . if the doj keeps dragging its heels too , and can just get away with it , why do we have an oversight committee in the first place ? it is like the white house has never heard of the separation of powers . john koskinen , a former ceo of freddie mac , is now in charge of the irs and will face aggressive questions on wednesday about a scheme to target right wing groups for extra scrutiny when they applied for special tax benefits hundreds of small and politically conservative tea party groups were screwed by the irs , according to house oversight committee chair darrell issa , a california republican not even a smidgen of corruption : president barack obama told fox news channel host bill o areilly on super bowl sunday that the irs 's hands were clean , despite an ongoing investigation of the kind that the white house routinely refuses to comment on the house of representatives , controlled by the gop , has already found attorney general eric holder in criminal contempt for refusing to hand over documents in the botched operation fast and furious gun trafficking scheme . but holder himself is the official responsible for enforcing the contempt finding , rendering him essentially outside the reach of congress . and despite the white house 's assurance that the justice department is investigating the most politically fraught irs scandal since the nixon administration , president barack obama said during a super bowl sunday interview that he was already sure there was not even a smidgen of corruption to be found – suggesting that he is not reserving judgment until an investigation has concluded . in june 2013 , white house press secretary jay carney told reporters that the president thought political targeting by irs officials was a problem . issa , a california republican , is calling irs top dog john koskinen to testify wednesday about what his agency has done to clean house . beginning in early 2010 , irs officials routinely held up tax exempt applications from conservative organizations , including tea party named groups , whose positions differed from the president 's some groups waited more than three years for their approvals , while politically liberal groups were fast tracked . foot dragging ? attorney general eric holder has promised to investigate the irs 's actions , but oversight committee republicans say the justice department will not show any evidence it is actually happening obama sacked the then acting commissioner , steven miller , promising in the white house east room that we will work with congress as it performs its oversight role . and our administration has to make sure that we are working hand in hand with congress to get this thing fixed . congress , democrats and republicans , owe it to the american people to treat that authority with the responsibility it deserves , he insisted , and in a way that doesn t smack of politics or partisan agendas . the good news is it s fixable , and it s in everyone s best interest to work together to fix it the scandal has galvanized disparate parts of the republican party , with libertarian leaning sen . rand paul and others firing up more traditionally conservative constituencies with red meat , anti irs messages obama nominated koskinen to take the place of daniel werfel , another interim commissioner , in august . he was confirmed during the week before christmas . we all hoped the new commissioner would be independent and at least make a move to toss out some of the bad apples , mailonline 's source said . but this is looking like more of the same . the committee is doing all it can , but if these guys refuse to obey the law there is not much anyone can do the irs 's complicity in the scandal that hamstrung hundreds of small tea party affiliated groups exploded in may 2013 when lois lerner , then in charge of the agency 's exempt organizations division , answered a self planted question about it during a professional conference . since then , she has refused twice to answer questions before the oversight committee , citing her fifth amendment right against self incrimination . the irs promised nearly three weeks ago that it will turn over all of lerner 's emails during the obama administration to the house ways and means committee – the oversight committee expects to share in the bounty of disclosures – but no documents have shown up on capitol hill . issa and other republican committee leaders released a report this month alleging that lerner believed the political participation of tax exempt organizations harmed democratic candidates , she believed something needed to be done , and she directed action from her unit at the irs . she was also involved , they wrote , in an off plan effort to write new regulations in a manner that intentionally sought to undermine an existing framework for transparency , and then engaged in efforts to cover it up by publicly denying that the irs was trying to change its evaluation criteria . still a target : lois lerner , who helmed the irs 's tax exempt application office while right wing groups were singled out for special scrutiny and held back for years at a time , has refused twice to answer questions before congress the net effect of the proposed new regulations – an effort described in irs emails as being developed off plan and away from public view – would be to codify the procedures that lerner put into place , in a way that republican congressional insiders say will permanently make it harder for conservatives to participate in the political process . instead of fixing a clear form of discrimination , they are trying to write it into stone , a second republican aide said monday . that s why so many people have complained about it more than 143,000 comments were logged in response to the irs 's regulatory proposal , a historic number that is second only to the obama administration 's requirement under the affordable care act that all qualifying insurance plans must include coverage for contraceptives.com mittee staff said monday on background that the irs has failed to turn over any requested documents about the proposed regulation . you watch on wednesday , the second staffer predicted : koskinen is going to bob and weave , and committee dem s are going to try and change the subject over and over again . this is probably going nowhere , again . unless the chairman has some new ammunition . i do not know that he does .:==:the irs commissioner will be called on the carpet this week for a wednesday hearing about the tea party targeting scandal . the tax agency played political favorites for more than three years , slow walking tax exempt applications from conservative nonprofits . the right wingers got dozens of intrusive questions from the irs that liberal groups did not have to answer . lois lerner , the official thought to be at the top of the scheme , has refused to testify before congress . the house oversight committee says the obama administration has ignored document subpoenas , and committee republicans want answers .

when the sirens sounded , 15 trained defenders would go to the roof . the anti aircraft gun mounted there was used once , when the red river was bombed in may 1972 . the planes came over the state bank , and the shooters on that roof also shot at the plane . i do not know if they found their mark . cao xuan nha 's memories of the vietnam war were brought vividly to mind with the recent opening of hotel sofitel legend metropole hanoi 's old air raid shelter . lost for decades , then rediscovered and now open to the public , the claustrophobic tunnels are a unique memorial to wartime vietnam one to the bonds formed during a time of fear and destruction , and to the role this iconic hotel has played over the last 111 years . nha , who was a member of the commission for external affairs , central committee of the communist party of vietnam , says the metropole was the only hotel in the city to have a shelter . he was responsible for taking care of government guests from 1969 until 1972 , all of whom were hosted at the hotel , then known as thong nhat . i was really happy when i found out that they had found the bunker and kai 's idea was to bring it back , he says . it is important for the hotel , important for the city and important for the country . cnngo : shenzhou 9 spacecraft boosts tourism in china 's space city in the months that followed its rediscovery , the shelter has been cleaned out and made safe for exploration . wartime relic made amenable it has a new entrance shiny new concrete steps more aligned with the luxurious trappings above than the darkness below but otherwise , the shelter is pretty much as it was found . the bare , low ceilinged rooms are dark , damp and musty . water drips from air ventilation shafts . old wiring curls out of rusted circuit breakers . dandong light bulbs nha remembers them being purchased are still screwed into their sockets . and former australian second secretary and consul bob devereaux 's graffiti is still discernible on the wall : bob devereaux , aug . 17 , 1975 . devereaux does not remember tagging the wall , but does recall fishing around the waterlogged shelter , then being used for storage , for documents and the odd elusive bottle of australian wine during his two year residency at the hotel . cnngo : world 's 50 best beaches devereaux was one of the first to tour the shelter on the metropole 's new path of history tour , which explains the hotel 's history over the last century and more . the shelter was built sometime during the mid 1960 s , and although the hotel staff has always known of its existence general manager kai speth says that at least one guest a week has enquired about it during his four year tenure at the hotel the shelter was unearthed by chance during the renovation of the hotel 's bamboo bar less than a year ago . speth says he felt a keen sense of responsibility to reopen the shelter as a tribute to the metropole 's war era staff . bombs were falling on hanoi and people were still coming to work nobody could guarantee a bomb would not fall on the hotel there were no laser guided missiles then , he says . when the decision was made to renovate the bamboo bar , speth decided to do some digging of his own . an adventure eventually we drilled into the space above the stairs , says speth . we created a cavity around 70 centimeters deep and were on our chests , looking around , and we could see there was a structure there . it was like an indiana jones adventure . in august 2011 , speth and his chief engineer finally broke through more than two meters of earth and reinforced concrete and the shelter 's 278 millimeter thick ceiling to emerge into a 40 square meter space , divided into five interconnecting rooms by heavy metals doors . it took a full week of pumping before the water level was brought down to 20 centimeters , and speth , wearing boots , shorts and an old t shirt , could splash down to explore . the shelter provided a unique glimpse into the hotel 's incarnation as a government run wartime guesthouse a world away from the opulence of its french colonial heyday . after being constructed by two french investors in 1901 , the metropole had quickly become one of asia 's most celebrated hotels . in 1923 , somerset maugham checked in with the sole purpose of finishing the gentlemen in the parlour . charlie chaplin spent his honeymoon in the hotel after marrying paulette goddard in shanghai in 1936 . in 1951 graham greene stayed for the first time , while writing the quiet american and acting as a correspondent for paris match . but during the war , well heeled travelers sipping coffee and fine cognac on the metropole terrace were replaced by scared vietnamese ducking into bomb shelters sunk into the pavement as the u.s. air force flew overhead . that image made the cover of life on april 7 , 1967 . stars check in even so , celebrities continued to check in , despite and often because of the war ravaging the country . in june 1972 , anti war activist jane fonda arrived at the hotel , and stayed on the second floor for two weeks . she spent many hours in the shelter , and autographed a photo taken there for a member of the staff : to van , with warmest wishes , hoa bin , jane fonda . i consider ms jane a close friend , says nha . she supported our country and i looked after her both times she visited , first alone and the second time with her son troy and husband tom . although the idea of defending the hotel against enemy aircraft with rifle fire seems laughable , its chefs , receptionists , waiters and cleaners were put through their paces by the army and each carried a weapon to guard the hotel against looters . while guests retreated to the relative safety of the shelter , the staff was in the open , trying to land a lucky shot when incoming enemy aircraft flew low enough . cnngo : hello kitty jets , the cutest airplanes ever echoes of the past the shelter did make an impression on one other guest : american folk singer joan baez , who stayed at the metropole during the christmas bombings in 1972 . her song , where are you now , my son ? was inspired by her experience in hanoi and the quiet and resolute perseverance of the vietnamese people . the track incorporates live recordings from her hotel stay while bombers raided the city . now , standing in the same space four decades later , we crowd around speth 's mobile phone in the warm , close space , sweat beading on our foreheads and lips , to listen as baez voice interspersed with the unmistakable sound of a wailing vietnamese woman , machine gun fire and bombs exploding cut eerily through the gloom . it is the first time in 40 years that nha has been down to the bunker , and he stands proudly , hand on heart , as he surveys the place in which he would spent many nights hoping for peace . path of history visitors from all over the world can now retrace the steps of former guests and staff . historian andreas augustin , who wrote a book on the history of the metropole , has helped train six volunteers from hanoi to lead guests of the hotel on a daily path of history tour , starting with a stroll between 13 glass displays and culminating with the exploration of the shelter . among the first to take the inaugural tour on may 21 were bob devereaux and gemma cruz araneta , a former filipino beauty queen and journalist who spent two months in hanoi in 1968 . araneta had described the shelter in her memoirs as a long , narrow , semi subterranean room of concrete which i thought would have made a groovy discotheque . although some had advised speth , only half jokingly , that he should turn the shelter into a wine cellar for the hotel , he is glad his determination to preserve the shelter in its wartime state has paid off . he believes that the metropole bunker will become a destination in its own right , just like the cu chi tunnels in south vietnam . i want people to feel that space to transport themselves there in the middle of the conflict , he says . it is really a place for reflection . if people come out and are a little emotional , that is mission accomplished for me to see it for yourself the shelter will be opened as part of the path of history guided tour , held daily at 5 pm and open to hotel guests only . contact the sofitel legend

site in a pair . the wedge heel made its appearance in the isolated state four or five years ago a trend that made its way across the border from china . today there are still plenty of wedge heels about , but it is the thin heel that is pyongyang 's must have fashion accessory today . 3 . you can bring your mobile visitors no longer need to leave their mobiles behind . as of january , you can bring your phone into the country and buy a local sim card from a booth at the airport . the sim card allows you to make and receive international calls and call other foreigners in pyongyang who have mobiles you cannot call locals as they are on a different network . a local sim card for two weeks goes for â‚¬50 $66 , but be warned calls are expensive $6.60 a minute to call the united states . north korea 's koryolink has more than 2 million subscribers . the local cell phones allow all the functions of a regular mobile make calls , listen to music , take photos with the exception of access to the internet . given the regular power outages , the light function on mobiles gets plenty of use . 4 . people love to sing most north koreans can carry a tune and if you ask someone politely to sing a song they will probably oblige on the spot , with no accompaniment . pop music is big , especially songs with lyrics . the best known western group is still the beatles hey jude and yellow submarine are high on the list and celine dion and the carpenters also go down well . no surprise then that most bars have karaoke . the all girl band moranbong is the most popular local group . the girls who were apparently hand picked by north korean leader kim jong un wear skimpy dresses and belt out pop tunes , the north 's answer to k pop . 5 . car park volleyball volleyball is one of the most popular sports and north koreans often strike up a game in their lunch hour . the games can be fast and fun , men and women often playing together . the lack of a net is no obstacle and many games start up casually in a car park or any open space . korean wrestling is also very popular . behind the veil : rare look at life in north korea 6 . the metro is seriously deep the pyongyang metro is 100 meters underground and it takes a couple of minutes to ride the escalator down to the station . the journey is long enough that some commuters sit on the steps despite the signs asking passengers not to there are no advertisements on the walls to distract you on the ride down to the station just bare white walls . there are only five advertising billboards in pyongyang , all owned by the same car dealership . the underground network has two lines and 17 stations . inspired by the grand moscow metro , many of the stations have ornate chandeliers and paintings and murals on the walls . 7 . crazy about kimchi kimchi spicy pickled vegetables is the national dish and it is said that every woman makes a different kind of kimchi . the dish is time consuming to make and the traditional recipe requires women to lovingly swirl and smear hot pepper paste over cabbage leaves for hours . simon cockerell of koryo tours , which specializes in travel to the reclusive socialist state , says : there is a saying that you must taste a woman 's kimchi before you marry her . 8 . single hearted unity north koreans seem to have an innate ability to form a line not a queue , but dead straight lines . the training begins as young children and by the time they are in their teens a crowd of hundreds can organize themselves into any number of parallel lines , equally spaced , in a minute . whether it is factory workers walking down the street , people gathering to lay flowers beneath a statue of the great leader , or soldiers jogging , moving in formation , showing single hearted unity is the order of the day . and it is catching . spend a week touring the capital and your guides will make sure you get give plenty of practice forming lines . 9 . you won t see that the local currency is the won , but foreigners are not allowed to use it instead visitors must use hard currency u.s. dollars , euros and renminbi . bizarrely , given the proximity to china , the renminbi offers the worst exchange rate . euros get the best rate at present . pyongyang is not a shopping destination . north koreans do most of their shopping in the local markets there is a blue roofed market in most neighborhoods , but foreigners are not allowed to visit these . officially , visitors are not allowed in department stores either , but this is a rule that is given much more flexibility . visitors tend to be herded into the foreign language bookstore and stamp and souvenir shops where you can stock up on propaganda posters , north korean stamps and postcards and books by kim jong il he wrote or ghostwrote hundreds . 10 . kim pins all north koreans wear a kim pin on the left breast of whatever they are wearing . the pins show a portrait of kim il sung or his son , kim jong il and sometimes both . surprisingly given that everyone wears one from infants to old folks there are no shops selling the pins . instead they are given out sporadically on special occasions and to mark significant events and there are lots of different styles . the style does not denote anything , just the period it was given out . there is a story that north koreans will be punished if they give a kim pin to a foreigner , but that is a myth and they are occasionally given to visitors . how to travel to north korea .:==:north koreans are enthusiastic beer drinkers . north koreans have a huge crush on heels and kimchi . if you are traveling in north korea , korean won would be the last currency you can see .
