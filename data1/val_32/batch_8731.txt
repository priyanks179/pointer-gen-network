it happened during my taxi ride from the airport to the hotel . after giving me a quick look , the cab driver asked : so where can i take you , father ? i had just arrived in silao , mexico located in the state of guanajuato , which has the highest percentage of catholics in mexico . yes , i was wearing a dark suit my blue shirt had no collar though but the confusion had to do more with the cab driver 's sense of anticipation than the way i looked . more than 3,000 archbishops , bishops , priests and nuns descended on guanajuato last week with the hope of meeting the head of the church . pope benedict xvi was coming to mexico for the very first time in his seven year papacy and the sense of anticipation was great . it was to be the pope 's first trip to spanish speaking latin america as well . the country was chosen carefully : mexico has the second largest population of catholics in the world , after brazil . by the time benedict arrived at el bajio airport friday afternoon , there were tens of thousands of people lining up the streets along the 20 mile stretch that would take him to colegio de miraflores , a catholic school run by nuns in the city of leon where the pope would stay three nights . most greeters were high school students who seemed genuinely excited about the pope 's arrival . but others were compelled to attend by schools and church authorities . the city of leon cancelled classes and declared a holiday . mexico was the first country pope john paul ii visited in 1979 , only months after being elevated to the papacy . benedict xvi has been pope for seven years and had received two personal invitations from mexican president felipe calderon , who traveled to the vatican in 2007 and again in may of last year . before the visit , many mexican catholics perceived benedict as a distant and reserved pope who felt uneasy when interacting with people a perception the catholic and the mexican church were trying to lay to rest . that probably explains the reason why benedict wore a broad brimmed sombrero on arriving at guanajuato state 's bicentennial park to celebrate a mass attended by hundreds of thousands . he again wore a sombrero when addressing worshippers congregated outside colegio de miraflores on the last night of his visit . i ve made a lot of trips , but i ve never been welcomed with such enthusiasm . now i can understand why pope john paul ii used to say i feel like i am a mexican pope , benedict told a crowd of thousands of excited followers . and then , there were the references to the virgin of guadalupe , the patron saint of mexico . as an academic with deep knowledge of theology and canon law , the pope is probably not thrilled about the fact that some mexicans put images of the dark skinned representation of the virgin mary right next to that of christ . to love her is to get committed to listen to her son to venerate the virgin of guadalupe is to live according to the words of the blessed fruit of her womb , the pope reminded people attending the open air mass . at the mass , the pontiff urged mexicans to rely on their faith to fight poverty , drug violence and other ills that have afflicted mexico in recent years . the pope made repeated references to the sorrow of recent violence in mexico . mexico is only three months away from holding presidential elections and the opposition questioned the timing of the visit . president calderon 's party , the pan , is catholic oriented and deeply conservative . the president appeared with the pope every single day of this visit . that would have been unthinkable before 1992 , when mexico resumed diplomatic relations with the vatican after a 130 year freeze . all four presidential candidates attended the pope 's main mass at the park . the only controversy about the visit surfaced saturday . on the same day pope benedict addressed and blessed a group of 1,800 children in guanajuato , three mexican authors released a book accusing the vatican of hiding or ignoring cases of child sex abuse by roman catholic priests . the book entitled la voluntad de no saber willing not to be aware , focuses on father marcial maciel , a now deceased , mexican born roman catholic priest accused of multiple cases of sexual abuse of minors . calls for the pope to meet victims of sexual abuse while in mexico went unanswered . the big question after the visit is whether pope benedict xvi was able to connect with young people . the catholic church has lost a significant number of members in the last few decades . the percentage of catholics now stands at 83 in a country that used to be almost universally catholic . was pope benedict able to erase the perception that he is a distant academic or is he now seen as a warm and affectionate , grandfather like figure , much like his predecessor ? only time will tell .:==:pope benedict xvi 's trip to mexico first since becoming pope seven years ago . once near universal , catholic population in mexico now stands at 83 . visits comes only three months away from mexico 's presidential election . pope benedict fighting image in mexico of being academic and aloof .

the chancellor weighed in to the row over the handling of the queen s finances last night , branding criticism of the royal household unfair . george osborne spoke as several tory mps yesterday accused the public accounts committee of meanness and grandstanding in a report in which it criticised courtiers for failing to balance the books and leaving dozens of royal residences in a state of disrepair . i think the public accounts committee chair is being unfair to the way the royal household has managed its finances , mr osborne said . chancellor george osborne said criticism of the royal family 's finances was unfair after a committee of mps said the queen should rent out her palaces they ve lived within a frozen budget over the last years and indeed the cost to the royal family for the taxpayer has come down quite sharply over the last couple of decades . the committee s chairman margaret hodge had said the queen should open up buckingham palace to the public for longer and consider money spinning ventures such as renting it out for commercial events . labour mp margaret hodge , who chairs the pac , said people were reluctant to criticise the royal finances but yesterday mr osborne said her committee appeared to have ignored significant savings made by the royal family in recent years . he added : let s not forget , not only are they a very important part of our constitution , but they are a huge attraction for tourists all around the world – the royal family generate a huge revenue for this country . senior royal aides said the backlog of building works has come about because of a real terms squeeze on their funding of up to 60 per cent over the past 20 years . they were backed by several tory mps , including jacob rees mogg who said it was bizarre the committee was focusing on royal expenditure of about £35 million rather than government spending of £700 billion . one has to wonder if it is possible that the reason they are spending so much time on such a trivial sum is because of the opportunities it affords for grandstanding , he said . there is a meanness in saying this is all very expensive – it is not . nadine dorries said : what i am totally against is this out and out yearly attack of the royal family because of who they are . they are great for britain , the british people love them . i actually felt quite embarrassed listening to margaret hodge reel off the list of repairs that need doing to the royal buildings that we have not funded as a country , because what the royal family does for us is beyond explanation . they put this little island of england on the world map . repair work : commons watchdogs insist the royals need more money spinning ventures to stop their palaces crumbling after years of complacency tory mp michael ellis said : i am sure the idea of opening up public access more will be looked at , but by the time the cost of extra security and so on has been included i doubt it would make much difference . what is needed is a proper consideration of the royal finances . after years in which the civil list was frozen by blair and brown . the report highlighted what is claimed to be repeated overspending by palace officials , forcing them to repeatedly dip into the queen s reserves . it also made great play of the fact 40 per cent of royal property – including buckingham palace and windsor castle – are of below acceptable standard . labour s mrs hodge told the mail she was shocked by the complacency of palace staff , adding that they are not serving the monarch well at all . she also asked why , given the backlog of works , £1.1 million of public money was found to renovate the duke and duchess of cambridge s home at kensington palace as well as an apartment for princess beatrice . in need of repair : the backlog of repairs is so great it will cost at least £50 million to restore the queen¿s london residence pictured in 2007 and other historic buildings tourist attraction : buckingham palace has been open to the paying public for around two months each summer since 1993 portfolio : the royal estate encompasses about 360 buildings including windsor castle , clarence house , st james palace and parts of kensington palace venue : a state banquet at windsor castle , and the interior of buckingham palace . it has emerged that us investment bank jp morgan hired buckingham palace out for a private dinner attended by the duke of york , tony blair and former un chief kofi annan .:==:commons watchdogs insist royals need more money spinning ventures . backlog of repairs is so great it will cost £50 m to restore crumbling palaces . public accounts committee wants courtiers to get firmer grip on finances . margaret hodge suggests extending opening season at main residence . but chancellor says the royals have already done a lot to cut costs . tory mps condemned political posturing by labour mps .

in 1948 , a hospital outside london witnessed the birth of the paralympic movement , as a jewish doctor who had fled nazi germany sought to change the lives of patients with spinal injuries and inspire new hope in them through sport . the first stoke mandeville games were organized in 1948 to coincide with the london olympics , the second to be held in britain . named for the hospital in buckinghamshire where prof . ludwig guttmann 's pioneering spinal injuries unit was based , the competitors in those initial games 14 men and two women took part in a wheelchair archery contest . many were military veterans injured on the battlefields of world war ii just a year later , six teams competed at stoke mandeville with wheelchair netball , a forerunner of wheelchair basketball , being introduced as sport became a central part of a rehabilitation process that had been revolutionized by guttmann . in 1956 , a statement of intent was unveiled for the games , which were by this time international , according to to the mandeville legacy website run by the local authority . it read : the aim of the stoke mandeville games is to unite paralyzed men and women from all parts of the world in an international sports movement , and your spirit of true sportsmanship today will give hope and inspiration to thousands of paralyzed people . four years later , inspired by guttmann 's vision , the first official paralympic games were held in rome in tandem with the olympics . and five decades on , some 4,280 paralympians from 165 countries the largest number ever have returned to britain to compete in what is now the premier international sporting event for those born with disabilities , or disabled by injury or illness . in an echo of those first stoke mandeville games , a number of those competing are military veterans , this time wounded in action in iraq and afghanistan . blinded in afghanistan the united states 227 member 2012 paralympic team includes 20 military veterans and active duty service members , almost 10 of the total . among them is navy lt bradley snyder , blinded last september in afghanistan when a homemade bomb exploded in his face . he will compete in a swimming event on the anniversary of his injury , the team usa website says . described by the united states association of blind athletes as an inspiration to others and a true american hero , snyder who made the swim team while at the u.s. naval academy returned to the sport within weeks of losing his sight . in order to make the london 2012 team , he is had to train hard and also learn how to steer a straight course in the lanes of a 50 meter pool without the aid of vision . there is no doubting his determination . i am not going to let blindness build a brick wall around me , usaba quotes snyder as saying . i would give my eyes 100 times again to have the chance to do what i have done and what i can still do veterans of the conflicts in iraq and afghanistan also figure in the 300 strong british squad , paralympicsgb . cyclist jon allan butterworth , who lost an arm to shrapnel from a rocket in basra , southern iraq , five years ago is one of them . he found his way into elite sport thanks in part to battle back , an initiative to boost the recovery of injured military personnel run by the uk ministry of defence , with help from uk charities , including help for heroes . butterworth , one of eight former or current british military service personnel selected for the games , was not an athlete before his injury but all that changed when he got on a bike at a talent spotting day for injured veterans . best thing that is ever happened within months , butterworth she would excess pounds , embraced the technical aspects of track racing and started to break national and world records . three years and two world championship titles later , he is keen to add a paralympic gold medal to his haul , he told cnn . the way i think of it now is , it is probably the best thing that is ever happened to me , he said of his injury . i ve met new people . i ve tried a few things out , different sports done loads of things that i never did before . it is kind of made me the person i am today . and i have changed since losing my arm , but i think only for the better . martin colclough , who runs the battle back phoenix program for help for heroes and was previously a major in the royal army physical training corps , told cnn that butterworth 's remarkable achievements had been helped by close cooperation between britain and the united states . shortly after the battle back program was set up in 2008 , a handful of british veterans traveled to san diego to join dozens of american paralympians at a sports training camp . there , butterworth who was going through a tricky period in his transition to cycling was inspired by u.s. track cyclist greta neimanas . quite literally , she lent a hand by letting butterworth try out her prosthetic arm , specially engineered for cycling , in place of his all purpose limb , colclough said . the gesture gave butterworth a vital confidence boost . this year , 17 british veterans were the first overseas athletes invited to compete in the warrior games , an event for disabled former and current service members staged by the u.s. olympic committee in colorado , colclough said . it is not necessarily easy for injured veterans to break into elite sport , especially competing against people who may have had decades to adapt to their impairments , rather than perhaps four or five years , colclough said . but colclough has high hopes both now and for the 2016 games in rio de janeiro , by which time the battle back program will have been running for twice as long . the self discipline and mental strength of those from a military background , coupled with the access they have to military training resources , helps them make the most of natural talent and fight to the top , he said . in addition , some uk paralympic training programs are run alongside the equivalent olympic programs , so all those involved can access the same sports science experts and groundbreaking technological advances . this is not a part time endeavor , colclough said . if you want to be world class as a paralympian , it is a full time occupation . watching around the world as the competitors from all backgrounds make their final preparations ahead of their big day on the world stage , excitement is building among those set to witness their endeavors . the london organizing committee says more people than ever before are due to attend these paralympic games , with a record 2.3 million tickets already sold and more set to be released . in addition , some 4 billion tv viewers around the world are expected to tune in live to the 11 day event , which opens wednesday , the usoc said . the international paralympic committee has said it will also stream more than 780 hours of sport live on its website , www . paralympic . org . in the united states , nbc plans to screen five and a half hours of the games , in four one hour shows and a 90 minute special . the usoc says this is more than was broadcast for previous paralympics , but some disappointed would be viewers have set up online petitions calling for greater coverage . over the course of the games , american athletes will take part in 19 of the 21 sports contested and attempt to improve on their third place in the medal tables in beijing . some of the events will be well known to those who were glued to the olympics athletics , archery , table tennis and cycling among them while others , such as goalball , played by the visually impaired , wheelchair rugby and boccia , a game similar to petanque , will be less familiar to many sports fans . viewers will have to familiarize themselves with a key element in how the paralympics work the system of classification of impairments , designed to ensure that athletes in each sport compete against similarly abled rivals . the uk government says it hopes the games will not only inspire more disabled people to embrace sport at all levels , but also help change public perceptions about disability . pride and honor one of those at the forefront of breaking down barriers is south african runner oscar pistorius , the first double amputee to compete in both the olympic and paralympic games . born with missing fibulas his legs were amputated below the knees as an infant pistorius uses special carbon fiber prosthetic limbs . nicknamed the blade runner , pistorius made it to the semifinals of the individual 400 meter and the 400 meter relay final at london 2012 , competing against able bodied athletes . he will be back in front of the roaring crowds at the olympic stadium to defend his paralympic 100 meter , 200 meter and 400 meter titles . his status as a world class athlete , as well as a disability pioneer , has seen pistorius grace the cover of publications from the new york times magazine to gq and men 's health in south africa . he also made it into time magazine 's list of the 100 most influential people in 2012 . the united states has its own blade runners in sprinter blake leeper , a double amputee who could challenge pistorius over 100 meters , and 22 year old jarryd wallace , from georgia . the latter had his right leg amputated two years ago because of a medical condition but has swiftly transitioned from a talented able bodied runner to a paralympic contender . other u.s. paralympians to watch in 2012 include swimmer jessica long , who took six medals at the beijing paralympics , four of them gold , and wheelchair racer jessica galli , who won five medals in 2008 and set a world record over 200 meters . our paralympians embody what it means to be an american , usoc chief executive scott blackmun says on the body 's website . they will compete with the pride and honor that is inherent in representing the united states of america , inspiring americans young and old with their stories of triumph . athletes from other nations will similarly dazzle and inspire those around them , as they overcome all odds to take home medals . from its humble beginnings in stoke mandeville , the place which also lends its name to one of the one eyed london 2012 mascots , the paralympic movement has come a long way . but in its commitment to bringing people together to test and celebrate what they can do , rather than what they cannot , its core spirit has remained unchanged . cnn 's matthew chance and jo shelley contributed to this report .:==:paralympic movement was born in stoke mandeville , outside london , in 1948.2012 games will be the biggest yet , with 4,200 competitors from 165 countries . in an echo of the first , post world war ii games , injured veterans are among the athletes . they include a u.s. naval officer blinded in afghanistan and a briton who lost an arm in iraq .

it was the most predictable and the most unpredictable of starts for luis suarez . he caused havoc in his first 45 mintues , creating a goal for neymar and what should have been a goal for messi but was the only one of barcelona s front there not to pick up an early booking . back from his four month ban for biting georgio chiellini the uruguayan striker kept himself out of trouble in the first half but was a constant thorn in pepe and sergio ramos side . it was his pass that set up neymar for the first goal . having started on the right he played in the brazilian who still had plenty to do and did it well to give barcelona the lead . videos scroll down to watch former liverpool striker suarez is tackled by isco as toni kroos and sergio ramos look on suarez was a constant thorn in the side of the real madrid defence and caused havoc on his barcelona debut suarez celebrates after assisting neymar just three minutes into his barcelona debut since his summer move he held the ball up well with his back to goal and aside from one loose pass to xavi his distribution was good . but barça have bought him for his ability to u.s.ttle opposition defenders and that is what he did throughout his first 45 minutes back in action . concerns had been aired pre match that he would not be fit enough to play the biggest fixture in european football but at times in the first half it had appeared it was pepe and sergio ramos who looked as if they had spent the last four months kicking their heels and not suarez . he should have had assist number two when he set up messi with an even better cross from the right but the argentine forward inexplicable failed to accept the gift . the game turned on that miss . suarez loses the ball to real madrid defender ramos as barcelona lost 3 to 1 to their fierce la liga rivals suarez creates a diversion as barcelona 's neymar moves forward with the ball as carvajal watches on suarez appears to gesture to the referee as ramos and dani carvajal keep a close eye on the frontman he went into one crunching challenge with isco that left him hobbling for the next five minutes feeling his right knee but came out for the second half going down under another challenge this time from luka modric that earned barça a free kick on the edge of the area . suarez is a fair way down the pecking order and xavi wasted the kick much to the former liverpool striker s frustration . suarez was still full of running in the second half and released neymar as barcelona tried to hit back straight away . with a lung busting run he made it into the area for the return pass but the referee penalised him for a foul on ramos as he lost and regained the ball from the spain defender . it was one of those fouls that probably would not have been given in the premier league and the reaction summed up that frustration throwing his arms up at referee jesus gil manzano . if luis enrique had decided to take suarez off on the hour he changed his mind with his first 15 minutes of the second half . he should have been awarded a foul after ramos pulled him back between the half way line and the penalty area . he grew increasingly frustrated as madrid s third goal went in there were others who looked to have tired more in the second half but his number nine finally came up on 70 minutes . there had been no dream comeback but barça fans disappointed at the heavy defeat can take much encouragement from the debut .:==:luis suarez loses 3 to 1 to real madrid on barcelona debut . uruguayan impressed in first game for catalan giants since summer switch . former liverpool striker was a constant threat throughout .

nasa engineers have fired up a 40 year old rocket engine they hope could help send man beyond the moon . the engine , known to nasa engineers as no f 6049 , was supposed to help propel apollo 11 into orbit in 1969 , when neil armstrong , buzz aldrin and michael collins went to the moon for the first time . however , while the mission was a success , the engine was grounded because of a glitch during a test in mississippi . the f 1 engine tested at nasa 's marshall space flight center , which was originally built for the apollo 11 mission the 18 foot tall f 1 engine , known to nasa engineers as no f 6049 , was supposed to help propel apollo 11 into orbit in 1969 , when nasa sent neil armstrong and two other astronauts to the moon for the first time . during moon missions , five of them were arranged at the base of the 363 foot tall saturn v system and fired together to power the rocket off the ground toward earth orbit . a single f 1 engine can produce 1.5 million pounds of thrust using a fuel composed of liquid oxygen and refined kerosene , which was not used in the space shuttle it was later sent to the smithsonian institution , where it sat for years , and now engineers are learning to work with technical systems and propellants not used since before the start of the space shuttle program , which first launched in 1981 . nick case , 27 , and other engineers at nasa 's marshall space flight center ran a series of 11 test firings of the f 6049 's gas generator , a jet like rocket which produces 30,000 pounds of thrust and was used as a starter for the engine . they are trying to see whether a second generation version of the apollo engine could produce even more thrust and be operated with a throttle for deep space exploration . there are no plans to send the old engine into space , but it could become a template for a new generation of motors incorporating parts of its design . in nasa speak , the old 18 foot tall motor is called an f 1 engine . during moon missions , five of them were arranged at the base of the 363 foot tall saturn v system and fired together to power the rocket off the ground toward earth orbit . thursday 's test used one part of the engine , the gas generator , which powers the machinery to pump propellant into the main rocket chamber . it does not produce the massive orange flame or clouds of smoke like that of a whole f 1 , but the sound was deafening as engineers fired the mechanism in an outdoor test stand on a cool , sunny afternoon . the device produced a plume that resembled a blow torch the size of two buses and set fire to a grassy area , which was quickly extinguished . it s not small , case said . it s pretty beefy on its own . and just like during the apollo days , people in north alabama heard rockets thundering in the distance during tests at marshall . apollo 11 taking off . the engine being tested was built for the 1969 mission , when nasa sent neil armstrong and two other astronauts to the moon for the first time my wife and daughter were in our front yard and she said they could hear it , which was pretty cool , case said after an earlier test . we live about 15 miles away . a single f 1 engine can produce 1.5 million pounds of thrust using a fuel composed of liquid oxygen and refined kerosene , which was not used in the space shuttle . the tests were conducted at marshall in a project conducted with dynetics inc . and pratt whitney rocketdyne , which are studying nasa 's possibilities for deep space missions years from now . the space agency plans to use commercial launches to reach low earth orbit larger rockets are required to escape the planet 's gravity . r h coates , an engineer who works with case in marshall 's liquid propulsion office , said young engineers can learn a lot from the work done by predecessors using slide rules in the 1960 s , but no one wants to simply rebuild the old saturn v engine . apollo 11 just after takeoff : now experts say its rocket motor could be updated for future missions this would not be your daddy 's f 1 , coates said . we d use new materials and try to simplify it , update it case started at marshall as a high school intern in 2002 and has been working there since graduating from the university of alabama in huntsville in 2008 . he said today 's technology allows things that were not possible during the 1960 s , but he has been impressed by what he learned taking apart the unused apollo 11 engine . engine no f 6049 did not fit properly on the apollo 11 rocket , but it is invaluable now as a testing tool . coates said a total of 85 f 1 engines were used on 17 apollo flights without a single failure . about a dozen f 1 engines remain in huntsville , ala . home of nasa 's main propulsion center , and others are located elsewhere . most are on display . case said engineers used engine no f 6049 for the tests because it was the most complete . it is really an excellent booster , he said

jeremy vine has been funnelling cash through a limited company , jelly vine productions , of which his daughter , martha , is a shareholder both pictured in a tongue in cheek guide to tax accounting for the rich , jeremy vine once advised the wealthy to find a tax magician with the power to bend the rules , befuddle the tax inspector and make money invisible . now it seems that the bbc radio 2 star has taken his own advice to heart . mr vine appears to have been using his ten year old daughter martha to avoid tax payments . the presenter of the jeremy vine show and the tv quiz eggheads , has been funnelling cash through a limited company , jelly vine productions , of which she is a shareholder . the controversial move will highlight the bbc s practice of paying some presenters off its books using money from the millions of pounds it earns in licence fee payers money . in 2012 , it emerged that more than 140 bbc stars were funnelling cash through private firms to avoid paying millions in tax . during the resulting furore , mr vine ran a spoof , jeremy s six step guide to tax avoidance for the rich , on his radio show . jelly vine productions had almost £810,000 in cash on its books in 2013 – the last accounts available , and £1 million in 2012 . if the funds had been paid to mr vine through the pay as you earn scheme used by most firms , it would have been taxed at 40 or 45 per cent . but by channelling them through a private firm , he can declare them as company profits , subject to corporation tax of 23 or 24 per cent . it is not clear whether these were earnings for mr vine s bbc work or included other fees such as payments for speeches or book royalties . but by arranging his finances in this way , he ensured jelly vine productions could pay dividends to its shareholders . the firm is controlled by mr vine , who has 51 per cent of the shares . his wife , rachel , has 30 per cent and the remaining 19 per cent is owned by martha , one of their two daughters . richard murphy , an accountant at tax research , said : he is obviously using the company to reduce his tax bill . it is perfectly legal , and perfectly allowed . jelly vine productions had almost £810,000 in cash on its books in 2013 – the last accounts available what is a little unusual is his daughter . let s be honest , she is unlikely to have said , “daddy , i want to spend my pocket money on shares in the company”. jelly vine productions accounts do not disclose how much it has paid out or whether it has paid dividends to all three family members , or just mr vine himself . mr murphy said mr vine could have named his daughter as a shareholder for long term tax planning purposes , reducing the tax she would pay if she inherits part of the business . alternatively , mr vine may have made his wife and daughter shareholders to split the dividend payouts , keeping them just small enough to ensure they are taxed at a lower rate , rather than at 40 or 45 per cent . a spokesman for the presenter said the reason for making his daughter a shareholder was private but perfectly legal , adding : i don t think it is cynical . what jeremy is doing is very common . if the government makes laws that allow people to do things that are advantageous , it is up to the government to change the laws . bbc contracts stipulate that presenters must pay the taxes they owe , and tells hmrc who it has paid each year . a spokesman said it would not comment on mr vine s arrangements , adding : it is the responsibility of self employed individuals to ensure they are paying the correct amount of tax .:==:bbc 's jeremy vine appears to have used daughter to avoid tax payments . daughter martha , aged 10 , is shareholder in jelly vine productions . the presenter has been funnelling cash through the limited company . controversial move highlights bbc practice of paying some presenters off the books using money from millions in earns in licence fee money .

is there hidden meaning in recorded jailhouse calls with former new england patriots star aaron hernandez after his arrest ? defense attorneys and prosecutors are in a pitched battle over whether a jury should be able to hear them during his ongoing murder trial in its eighth full week of testimony . snippets of the conversations are contained in motions filed by both sides . the transcribed excerpts include hernandez talking with his fiancée , shayanna jenkins , and also with his cousin tanya singleton . there is also a debate about calls between singleton and co defendant ernest wallace . prosecutors contend calls involving wallace , singleton , and jenkins , in particular , are proof of an ongoing conspiracy to conceal evidence after the june 17 , 2013 , killing of odin lloyd . the defense argues the calls are irrelevant , prejudicial and contain hearsay . aaron hernandez trial : the latest developments hernandez has pleaded not guilty to orchestrating lloyd 's killing with the help of wallace and carlos ortiz . wallace and ortiz have pleaded not guilty and are being tried separately . singleton and jenkins both face charges of their own stemming from lloyd 's killing . singleton has pleaded not guilty to being an accessory after the fact , accused of helping wallace escape to florida . singleton , suffering from terminal cancer , is expected to be called as a state 's witness . she previously served time for contempt of court for refusing to testify before a grand jury . in calls between singleton and wallace after he was arrested but before she was jailed on the contempt charge prosecutors contend she is passing on information from wallace to hernandez . at trial , authorities suggest hernandez was reaching out to wallace the night lloyd 's bullet riddled body was discovered . jurors have been shown surveillance video and phone records authorities say show hernandez borrowing his attorney 's cell phone to call wallace that night from the north attleboro police station parking lot after hernandez took apart his own phone . during previous cross examination , the defense has argued there is no proof of what that call was about and there was nothing unusual about taking a battery out of a cell phone , then putting it back together . hernandez 's fiancée , jenkins , has pleaded not guilty to lying before a grand jury . prosecutors suspect her of getting rid of the murder weapon after receiving a coded text message from hernandez a day after lloyd 's killing . the jury has seen a home surveillance video of her removing a trash bag from the house and driving away with it in a car . the handgun , believed to be . 45 caliber glock , has never been found . court documents state all jailhouse calls are recorded , and detainees are notified by signs and recorded messages that their phone conversations are being monitored . below are excerpts of some of the calls the defense wants to quash and prosecutors want the jury to hear : july 12 , 2013 call between tanya singleton and ernest wallace wallace : you tell ink , tell ink , i love him , man . i love him . singleton : i will . wallace : tell him no matter what , do not think i am la la la ing . i will never go against the grain , you hear me ?

the only good thing about tanya being locked up is she is going to lose weight . in another call between jenkins and hernandez , jenkins apparently is not happy that he is asking her to put money into singleton 's jail canteen account . the defense argues it has no relevance to the murder charge . jenkins : i do not know why you keep . hernandez : she is got no money in jail . jenkins : . why do i have to keep being the one to do that ? that is what you are not understanding . hernandez : all right well jenkins : i am trying to follow what my lawyers are telling me to follow , and then you keep trying to have me do other things . hernandez : not really , but i am saying whatever works for you . some excerpts are singled out by both defense and prosecutors for different reasons . in a call dated july 23 , 2013 , the defense suggests hernandez appears to be doing an act of kindness for his loyal cousin by setting up a trust fund for her children . hernandez : i set up an account , do not tell nobody , for jano and . so , do not tell nobody . i do not want nobody to know about it and i are not even telling my own girl , nobody . because it already started off at $100,000 for them . in their motion , prosecutors appear to suggest it is a payoff disguised as a gift . will the calls be played in court ?

newtown . aurora . columbine . tucson . virginia tech . the tragic shootings in each of these and other towns have ignited public sentiment for some kind of gun reforms and fired up gun advocates to protect what they see as their constitutional right of easy access to firearms . according to recent polls , more than 90 of americans favor some form of background checks for firearm purchases , particularly at gun shows , but the efficacy of the measure remains dubious by both law enforcement and gun control advocates . but , as congress wrestles with what new measures if any should be passed to control gun purchases , one question looms : in those and other mass shootings , would background checks have made any difference ? how background checks work looking back , background checks did not stop three mass shootings that claimed more than 40 lives since 2011 . in the massacre in newtown , connecticut , where 26 people , mostly children , were gunned down at sandy hook elementary school , adam lanza used two semi automatic handguns and a semi automatic rifle . he did not get a background check for those weapons . they were legally purchased and registered to his mother , nancy lanza , who was his first victim . last july , james holmes walked into a crowded theater in aurora , colorado , and began shooting . his ar 15 , two 9 mm glocks , . 40 caliber pistol and 12 guage shotgun were all purchased legally , after his name was submitted to the national instant criminal background check system . twelve people were killed . the same is true with jared loughner , who shot then rep . gabrielle giffords and 19 other people , killing six , in tucson in january 2011 . his application was never flagged when run through nics the database from which potential firearms buyers are determined legally eligible to purchase a gun . nra plucks the bird to weaken gun proposals the one shooter that might have been prevented by background checks and was not was the virginia tech shooter because he had , in fact , been adjudicated to be potentially violent , said national rifle association president david keene . seung hui cho , who killed 32 people in 2007 on the picturesque virginia tech campus in blacksburg , had been deemed mentally ill by a judge , which is one of the criteria used to disqualify certain people trying to buy a gun . others who could be potentially disqualified include convicted felons , fugitives , drug addicts and domestic abusers . cho 's case apparently slipped through the cracks and the state of virginia has since instituted a series of reforms in its reporting procedures to nics as a result . cho might have been stopped if universal checks were the law , vice president joe biden said . one of the problems that was pointed out here was that there was an adjudication of the young man that committed the crime at virginia tech , and yet he was able to go out and purchase two weapons , biden said in january . the current senate proposed bill called the fix gun checks act seeks to remedy the database deficiencies by forcing the states to become more involved in submitting names into the existing system . the sticking point with the proposal for many anti gun control proponents is the requirement that background checks cover every firearm sold , whether at gun shows , the internet or private sales . sens . joe manchin iii , d west virginia , and patrick j toomey , are pennsylvania , announced wednesday a bipartisan deal on background checks for gun shows and internet sales , but a similar agreement in the house is still unlikely . sen . chuck schumer , d new york , who wrote the latest senate bill , said his was an expansion of the 1994 brady handgun violence prevention act that banned military style assault weapons for a decade before it expired . every major expert believes that universal background checks will save lots of lives , schumer told cnn . he added that 1.7 million people have gone to firearms dealers and been denied guns because they were felons or adjudicated mentally ill because of the brady law . but the nra 's keene disagreed . the tipping point for all this gun control talk about background checks is actually an example of how background checks do not matter . killer will find a way to get a gun even if he kills the owner .:==:mass shootings have ignited public sentiment for some kind of new gun control . examples of gunmen in recent mass shootings suggest background checks not a panacea . the virginia tech case is one where a background check might have made a difference . gun rights advocates oppose universal checks , any new record keeping requirement .

yesterday after more than a week on the run . daniel lalanne , his french lawyer , said : we have discussed how he feels about being taken back to britain and he will not contest it this is primarily because going home will take him back closer to the person he loves . his only crime is to have fallen in love with a 15 year old , without any recourse to violence or manipulation . of course he is devastated and only wants to be reunited with megan . forrest will appear in court in bordeaux on tuesday for formal extradition proceedings . he confessed the couple had planned to lie low in bordeaux for another six months when they could legally return to the uk as lovers when megan turned 16 . hotel staff now concede there was something unusual about the couple . for instance , mr forrest left megan waiting outside , her arms sheepishly folded , while he checked in , paying €61 cash up front . he seemed calm and relaxed but i never saw her close up , said a hotel worker . police are now investigating how the passport belonging to mother of five mrs wilson came into her daughter s hands – and how the teenager managed to pass herself off as 37 years old . they went to paris but soon dumped mr forrest s ford fiesta and boarded a tgv train at montparnasse station then travelled to bordeaux , 400 miles away in the south west of the country . once there , they were not required to show their passports when they checked into the choiseul , a two star hotel which stands half way down the rue huguerie in central bordeaux . they stayed just one night and , then , after repeatedly moving hotels , mr forrest who had been scrupulous about remaining anonymous made the crucial error when applying for the bar job . on camera : cctv footage of megan stammers and jeremy forrest earlier this year mr forrest had spent six days in los angeles with 50 pupils and five other teachers from the bishop bell school . it was on that trip that pupils were reportedly shocked to see mr forrest holding hands with megan as they sat together on the flight home . further details have emerged about the group s itinerary , which began on february 11 when they checked into the £100 a night sportsmen s lodge hotel which , in hollywood s golden era , hosted stars such as clark gable , humphrey bogart and katharine hepburn . megan was given room 229 , on the first floor , sharing with three friends . mr forrest was close by in room 211 with another male teacher . the trip included a tour of disneyland and universal studios , a visit to warner bros and sony studios , and a stroll along the hollywood walk of fame . they visited the millionaires shopping playground of rodeo drive in beverly hills , walked on venice beach , and explored the legendary sunset strip . staff at the lodge remembered forrest as friendly and capable but did not notice megan among the other students . sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .:==:jack francis dean was a northampton university journalism graduate . cv said he had 10 gcses , four a levels and worked for nme and kerrang . forrest used cv to apply for french job when manageress recognised him .

martin o neill has warned roy keane to expect a champions league baptism of fire should he agree to step into the celtic hotseat . dermot desmond , celtic s largest shareholder , has held informal talks with the former manchester united captain concerning the parkhead job vacated by neil lennon . the scottish champions insisted last night keane has not been offered the job and released a statement claiming they are still talking to a number of candidates . mentor : ex celtic boss martin o neill has told roy keane to expect celtic champions league baptism of fire boyhood dream : keane played for celtic for a few months during the twilight of his career and o neill made it clear he wants his right hand man to stay . indeed , with just eight weeks until a crucial champions league qualifier at murrayfield , he urged keane to consider the implications of stepping into a high pressure situation . celtic are back so early because they re involved in those big games , said o neill . so it is a case of that being only a matter of days away rather than weeks and i m sure that s something to consider . it was only brought home to me the other day when anthony stokes was mentioning he would not be coming with us to america because he would have had no break because celtic are back training very , very quickly because he s had no break whatsoever . if roy is actually offered the job then he ll have things to consider . the very obvious thing to consider is the speed at which he would go into a big football club and have big , big games right on his doorstep . a celtic manager for five years , o neill remains an iconic figure at parkhead and will advise his right hand man carefully . he admitted : i have spoken to him . i had a call the other day from dermot desmond wanting to speak to roy if it was at all possible , and i mentioned it to roy , of course . i am sure he was wanting to have chat anyway because a club like celtic might not come around too often . it was just a really informal chat , i think , but if you are asking me would i be really disappointed ? of course if roy was to leave us but i kind of felt that when i took him on in the first place , that over the course of the next 18 months to two years , that this thing was likely to happen . he was coming right back into high profile again . perhaps i didn t expect it to happen so quickly , but celtic is one he has had a number of offers too from other football clubs as well so he has obviously a lot to consider . informal chat : ireland boss martin o neill says keane has spoken with celtic owner dermot desmond new job : roy keane , the ireland assistant manager , is set to be named as the new celtic boss still got it : keane on the ball during an ireland training session ahead of saturday friendly with italy in london keane endured mixed fortunes in charge of sunderland and ipswich and celtic fans have reacted coolly to news of the talks . he has been out of frontline management since being sacked by ipswich in january last year . insisting the irish stint brokered by desmond and funded by his billionaire business crony denis o brien has rehabilitated the former midfielder , however , o neill said : roy has been great for me , i ve genuinely enjoyed working with him , he s sometimes a totally different character to the one you see in front of the tv camera . he s been excellent , the players have enjoyed him immensely . i can only say that naturally i d be disappointed if he left because i really think he s been terrific . i ve often said here that he ll be a manager again himself . i just didn t expect it that quickly . again , it was only an informal discussion he was having . i don t know the ins and outs of it , i don t know , i think they do have a list of people they re speaking to and , you never know , they might speak to someone else i just reiterate he wouldn t take it lightly . he loves it here , genuinely loves it here . it s been great for him . discussion : keane talks to manager martin o neill as coaches steve guppy and steve walford watch on pundits : keane and o neill on air for itv during coverage of a champions league tie last season the statement from celtic last night made it clear keane is but one of the candidates they are looking at it read : following speculation concerning the manager s position at celtic the club can confirm that it is currently continuing its discussions with a number of excellent candidates . but last night charlie mulgrew backed keane to show the right stuff as celtic manager and said : i m sure he d be a good man for the job . as a player i think the club needs a big character and he definitely fits the bill . he s a strong character and probably the type of guy that would be good for the job . of course , we want a manager as soon as possible because it gets us prepared for the champions league qualifiers . but i m sure the club will take its time to get the right man . as long as it s a big character . i m sure the club will look into it and find the right man for the job . one player who may not be around to see keane s potential takeover is goalkeeper fraser forster with tottenham placing him on a list of potential replacements for hugo lloris .:==:roy keane has had informal talks with dermot desmond , celtic 's largest shareholder . scottish champions insisted keane has not been offered the celtic job and is just one of a number of candidates . keane is currently martin oneill s right hand man for republic of ireland .

an extremely rare set of 400 year old playing cards made of silver and gold that were owned by a princess have been discovered . the extraordinary deck of silver cards gilded with gold were first sold at auction at christie s auction house for £2,421,123 in 2010 . recently a historian described them as one of only five known decks of silver cards and the only complete set . gilded with gold : the set of silver cards is one of only five known decks and the only complete set and was created around 1616 legend has it that the cards were owned by portuguese princess infanta carlota joaquina , who married a prince in portugal before fleeing to brazil when napoleon s armies marched into iberia in 1807 . stories say she took the set with her . timothy schroder , a historian specialising in gold and silver decorative arts , recently wrote in his book : only five sets of silver cards are known today and of these only one — the zilkha set referring to the current owner — is complete . they were not made for playing with but as works of art for the collector 's cabinet , or kunstkammer . creating the silver cards was a hazardous job as each of the 52 cards was gilded using mercury , a deadly chemical , a process which is illegal today . even in renaissance times , people knew the process was dangerous . risky process : mercury was used to gild the gold to the silver a process which is illegal today and even in renaissance times , people knew the process was dangerous mr schroder was quoted in live science saying : i do not think they quite understood why it was dangerous , but they did appreciate the dangers of it you ground up gold into kind of a dust , and you mix it with mercury , and you painted that onto the surface where you wished the gilding to appear . he explained that the mercury disperses in the kiln in a process that would leave the gold chemically bonded to the silver . in her hands : legend has it that portuguese princess infanta carlota joaquina took the set of silver cards with her when she fled to brazil as napoleon 's armies marched into iberia in 1807 prince carlota is thought to have given the silver cards to the wife of felipe contucci , a man who helped her try to take the spanish crown after napoleon forced her brother , ferdinand vii , to abdicate . the cards were created in germany around 1616 and engraved by michael frömmer at a time when no standardised style of cards existed . at the time , different parts of europe had their own styles of cards . this set uses a suit that has been seen in italy with coins , swords , cups and batons each suit with a king , a knight , a knave , and pip cards ace through ten . each card is about 3.4 x 2 inches and blank on the back .:==:they are one of just five known sets and the only complete set . rare , complete set of silver cards sold at auction in 2010 for £2,421,123 . a portuguese princess took them with her when she fled napoleon 's armies . they were gilded with gold using mercury , a process illegal today .

an arrest warrant has been issued in the case of 18 year old hannah graham , a university of virginia student who disappeared more than a week ago . the warrant is for jesse matthew , who police believe was the last person to see her . he is wanted on suspicion of abduction with the intent to defile , charlottesville police chief timothy longo told reporters tuesday . one day earlier , a new search warrant was issued for matthew 's apartment . authorities found specific clothing they were looking for , longo said on cnn 's new day . the clothing was sent to a lab for analysis . the charlottesville police department is circulating a wanted poster for matthew , 32 , who is also wanted on two counts of reckless driving . many questions remain unanswered , but here is what cnn knows and does not know so far : what we know who is graham ? she is a second year university of virginia student making straight a 's , her parents say . hannah is beyond precious to us , john and susan graham said in a statement released shortly after she went missing . we are truly devastated by her disappearance . it is totally out of character for us not to have heard from her , and we fear foul play . holding a stuffed bunny named bb , his daughter 's favorite plush toy and guardian angel , john graham pleaded last weekend for someone to come forward with information on his daughter , who he said loved helping people . last spring break , instead of hanging around on the beach , she spent a week in tuscaloosa rebuilding houses , her father said . the northern virginia native is 5 feet 11 inches tall with a slender build and has light brown hair , blue eyes and freckles . she was last seen september 13 wearing a black crop top , according to a uva news release . where was she before her disappearance ? on the evening of september 12 , she was seen at a party before friends saw her at an apartment complex a couple of blocks away from the party . that was shortly before midnight , according to a timeline compiled by cnn affiliate wvir . about 12:45 am on september 13 , a surveillance camera caught her outside of a pub , about three quarters of a mile from the apartment complex . a doorman turned her away at the pub , longo said sunday . ten minutes later , she is seen running past a gas station no one appears to be pursuing her and witnesses say they saw her five minutes later roughly four blocks from the gas station , wvir reported . she was at a restaurant in an area known as downtown mall , witnesses said . the surveillance camera at an italian cafe captured her walking along the mall about 1:06 am the camera at a jewelry store recorded her passing two minutes later , wvir reported . at 1:20 am she texted her friends to say she was lost and trying to find a party , wvir reported . she and a man were seen having drinks at a bar between 1:30 and 2 am , wvir reports . police believe she may have been under the influence of alcohol , longo said , and may have been vulnerable or unable to defend herself . what are police doing to find her ? i believe jesse matthew was the last person she was seen with before she vanished off the face of the earth , the police chief said sunday . we want to talk to him . anyone who saw matthew 's burnt orange 1998 chrysler coupe that night should call the police tip line at 434 295 3851 , longo said . police had previously said they were looking for a man who did not fit matthew 's description , but rather was a black male in his 20 s or 30 s with a shaved head and goatee . matthew has dreadlocks . i hope and pray that we might have an opportunity to talk to jesse matthew again because i think he can help up find hannah graham , the police chief said . in addition to monday 's search warrant , authorities previously searched matthew 's apartment and car but have declined to say what if anything was found . they have interviewed at least 50 people and received more than 100 tips in the case . last weekend , more than 1,200 volunteers and virginia department of emergency management officials spent the weekend searching for clues that would lead them to graham , cnn affiliate wtvr reported . as time passes , the search area grows , investigators say . authorities are offering a $50,000 reward for information leading to graham 's safe return . what we do not know where is matthew ? matthew willingly went to a police station last weekend , along with several family members , walking through the front door and asking for a lawyer , the police chief said . there was no warrant for his arrest at that time . matthew and the lawyer spoke and then left , longo said , giving detectives no clearer picture of what may have happened the day graham disappeared . police executed a new search warrant at his home monday , and matthew 's landlord told wvir that police took two items . she also told wvir that she had not seen matthew since thursday , and two of his roommates had moved out . the university of virginia medical center confirmed to wvir that matthew has worked there since august 12 . matthew is known to have contacts in maryland , new york , pennsylvania , virginia and washington , according to police . are there links to other cases ? the short answer is no however , the route 29 corridor where graham disappeared has a peculiar history . according to wtvr , graham is the fourth woman to disappear from the area since 2009 . morgan harrington of charlottesville , alexis murphy of lovingston and samantha clarke of orange also went missing there . all the women were between 17 and 20 years old , wvir reported . in july , randy taylor , 43 , was sentenced to two life terms for murphy 's 2013 abduction and murder , although her body was never found , wvir reported . clarke 's mother is still looking for answers more than four years after her 19 year old 's disappearance . harrington , a 20 year old virginia tech student , went missing after attending a metallica concert in charlottesville in october 2009 . her remains were found on a farm months later . police have yet to track down her killer , and her family has long said they suspect there could be other victims . the t shirt harrington was wearing when she disappeared was found near where graham disappeared . certainly the question has arisen . it is certainly a legitimate question , longo told reporters this month . harrington 's mother told wtvr that route 29 has an infamous reputation . i do not know . either there is a commonality or a crime spree , she told wtvr . we have long passed a critical mass that needs looking at if you look at the map of missing and abducted along route 29 it is not a normal pattern .:==:an arrest warrant is issued for 32 year old jesse matthew . he is wanted on suspicion of abduction with the intent to defile . videos provide a timeline of hannah graham 's movements on night she vanished . she disappeared september 13 police believe matthew was last person to see her .

with a manager as combustible and as clever as jose mourinho , you always know that he is going to blow at some stage of the season . by highlighting anthony taylor s performance at southampton , where the referee gave cesc fabregas a yellow card for diving , mourinho created some hysteria . that was a carefully orchestrated move by mourinho , delivering the same message in each of his post match press conferences with equal conviction . jose mourinho 's comments about referee anthony taylor were a calculated move designed to heap pressure on officials in the all important premier league title run in , possibly to chelsea 's benefit mourinho criticised taylor after cesc fabregas was booked for diving during chelsea draw at southampton fabregas was infuriated by taylor 's decision , believing he was fouled and deserved a penalty at face value it looked like he was trying to attack pundits , experts and analysts . by turning his fire on them , and away from the referee , he avoided an fa charge . but his real target was referees . the title race could be decided by a referee s decision and mourinho wants to influence them . at white hart lane on new year 's day , phil dowd is on notice and will be well aware that chelsea have not been awarded a penalty away from stamford bridge this season . that is an incredible statistic . dowd is one of the most volatile referees in the barclays premier league . whenever he booked me he would flash the card so quickly that it felt he was about to punch me dowd treats players like little boys and can inflame and aggravate situations . he really used to wind me up this is a big test for him , a big night at white hart lane for tottenham , and it comes just a few weeks after mauricio pochettino s team lost 3 to 0 at stamford bridge . speaking on sky sports , mourinho claimed that officials have a campaign against chelsea the chelsea boss clearly feels that decisions have gone against his team at key moments this season fabregas reacts with incredulity after being booked for simulation after going down in the area chelsea currently have a three point advantage at the top of the barclays premier league dowd s last chelsea match was their 1 to 1 draw at old trafford . he sent off branislav ivanovic in the 90 th minute and robin van persie equalised 45 seconds later . if there are any tricky decisions to be made tonight , dowd might have jose s comments ringing in his ears . mourinho is a brilliant team builder . he quickly identifies areas he needs to improve and creates a because like no other manager in the premier league . it can work as a real positive energy . he is a trophy hunter and there is a lot of silverware to be won before he is done with english football . but his team , for all their quality , are stuttering on their travels after losing at newcastle and drawing at sunderland and southampton . it is easy to criticise a referee , to distract people from a performance , but i believe his recent comments were deliberate because he showed restraint . he did just enough to create headlines and debate — and to get inside the heads of referees . mourinho is a master manipulator , using situations to his advantage , and he knows the pressure is on chelsea in the second half of the season . manchester city are lurking in striking distance . at some stage his dressing room will feel tension because they are leading from the front and are expected to win their first premier league title since he returned to chelsea . boot room preview for tottenham vs chelsea on new year 's day mourinho was left furious after branislav ivanovic was sent off in the late stages at old trafford robin van persie scored united 's equaliser seconds after ivanovic was sent off at old trafford at arsenal we had all sorts of little psychological ploys to gain an advantage before kick off . mourinho works the same way . we would never come out of the dressing room at highbury until the opposition were waiting for us in the tunnel . we are arsenal , we decide when we come out . in matches against manchester united i would deliberately shield the officials as they came off the pitch at half time so that sir alex ferguson could not get to them . in games of this magnitude , you will seize upon any little advantage . mourinho must keep his players onside , convince them that they are the best team as they enter this crucial second half of the season . chelsea players do dive . they have had four yellow cards for simulation this season and there is a reason for that — our eyes are not deceiving us clearly , though , mourinho wants to create an us against the world mentality . eden hazard kept chelsea on track with his equalising goal at southampton on sunday fabregas is brought down by southampton 's matt targett in the incident that started the debate mourinho goes mad on the touchline after chelsea appeals for a penalty are waved away that attitude can really bond a group because if you feel you are hard done by , you are even more determined to play well . the other , more subtle impact is on referees . there is no doubt mourinho makes comments like these to increase the pressure on officials . still , complaining in such exaggerated terms about chelsea being victimised does not cast him in a good light . his team are top of the league and playing some of the best football ever seen at stamford bridge . he doesn t need to complain , just win matches . no one wants to see a whingeing manager win trophies and as brilliant as mourinho is — he s one of the best — he might want to keep a lid on what he is saying . when he came back to stamford bridge he talked about staying a long time . to do that he needs to make friends , not enemies . just when we were starting to like him again he overstepped the mark at southampton . he has self destructed at previous clubs and had to leave . he can t afford to do the same again . there isn t a campaign or witch hunt against chelsea but mourinho has stepped up the pressure on match officials at a crucial stage of the season . tonight it will be fascinating to see how dowd handles it .:==:jose mourinho alleged a campaign by referees against chelsea this week . it came after cesc fabregas was booked for diving at southampton . referee anthony taylor later said sorry to mourinho for not giving penalty . but mourinho 's comments are a carefully orchestrated move . the portuguese is making a deliberate effort to influence referees . he knows title race with manchester city could come down to decision .
