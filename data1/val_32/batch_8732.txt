two years after his wife of 34 years died in a fire , an iowa man continues to maintain the blaze was started by a faulty cruise control switch under the hood of her 1996 ford f 150 pickup while it was parked in the garage attached to his home . ford says a faulty cruise control switch did not start the blaze that engulfed dolly mohlis f 150 truck . although ford has denied and continues to deny the switch started the fire that killed 74 year old dolly mohlis in 2005 , the company recently settled a lawsuit brought against it by earl mohlis . and last week , it issued a recall of an estimated 3.6 million vehicles bringing the total recalled over the past decade to more than 10 million every single car and truck built with a similar cruise control switch . dolly mohlis woke up smelling smoke in may 2005 , earl mohlis has told cnn . she woke him to find out the source while she called 911 . when he looked in the garage , he said , he saw the truck was in flames . earl mohlis said he opened the garage door to try to get the truck out , but the wind blowing that night at about 50 mph fanned the flames , which spread to the house . the fire department in the mohlises rural town could not arrive fast enough . dolly mohlis , who suffered from debilitating arthritis , was suddenly trapped inside the home . i says to dolly , you got to get out of that house , earl mohlis told cnn . she come a running , and she never made it watch mohlis describe how the flames trapped his wife in 2005 , cnn began airing a series of investigative reports on unexplained and sudden fires in ford cars and trucks . they found that a tiny electrical switch in the cruise control system could lead to the vehicle catching fire , even hours after the car was turned off . although ford had begun recalling the parts in some vehicles in 1999 , a sweeping recall was not issued until earlier this month . ford says media reports like those on cnn have sparked fear among ford owners . the newly recalled vehicles , a ford spokesman told cnn , do not have a higher than normal fire incidence . asked about the recall , a ford spokesman told cnn the company was voluntarily announcing the recall because it could not be confident about the long term durability of these switches and to address consumer concerns about the potential for fires . cnn has learned , however , that federal investigators were continuing to observe what one safety official said were elevated levels of suspect fires in ford vehicles that had not been the subject of a recall . since the cruise control switch was introduced in 1992 , the national highway traffic safety administration had documented more than 600 blazes . the safety official said investigators with nhtsa were discussing safety concerns with ford when the company announced the massive recall last week . neither mohlis nor ford released terms of the settlement , but mohlis told the des moines register he still cries for his wife every day . e mail to a friend .:==:earl mohlis says faulty cruise control switch caused fire that killed his wife . ford denies the switch started the blaze company settled mohlis lawsuit . ford has recalled more than 10 million vehicles in past decade . cnn in 2005 began airing investigative reports on sudden fires in ford vehicles .

sister madonna buder is not your average nun , nor your average 82 year old woman for that matter . this spirited washington based senior has completed more than 340 triathlons 45 of them the notoriously grueling ironmans and she only started when she was 48 . people often ask me how i train for these kinds of these arduous events , she tells cosmopolitan magazine . and to that i say , i just boogie . the iron nun : sister madonna buder has finished more than 340 grueling triathlons in her life , and she only ran her first race when she was 48 years old sister buder says she was never into running as a child , but she was clearly born with a determined streak from the start . she decided she wanted to become a nun at the age of 14 , and by the age of 23 , she had entered a convent near her home in missouri . she later transferred to the sisters for christian community in spokane , washington state , where she did not take up running as a hobby until she was 48 years old . when , a short while later , she approached her bishop , father john , to seek his approval on whether it was ok for her to enter a race , he replied : sister , i wish some of my priests would do what you are doing . the deal was sealed then and there , and sister buder ran her very first 8.2 mile race , ass backwards she says , because the only place she had ever trained before was on a tennis court . no excuses : sister buder , pictured at the hawii ironman world championship at the age of 77 , did not have her own bike , so trained for the race using her nephew 's bike instead , during visits to her missouri home after that , she joined a running group , where she thrived on the group mentality , and it was here she eventually learned of the ironman triathlon in hawaii . her first thoughts were of how claustrophobic she would feel swimming along with so many others , her second was that she could not conceive of sitting in a bike saddle for so long , and her third was that she simply had to try . the steely nun competed in her first triathlon in branbridge , ireland , at the age of 52 . the course was hilly , she swam in the wouldarn cold water before wetsuits had been invented , and she was riding a second hand men 's bike she had scored from a police auction . nevertheless , she finished the race and cooled off with an overwhelming sense of accomplishment . omen : the spirited nun , pictured here blessing a fellow athlete before a 2007 race , took part in the 2013 boston marathon and was twice randomly urged to memorize a police officer 's phone number before the bombings next stop : hawaii , where she broke world records as the oldest women ever to complete the course . she practiced on her nephew 's bike during visits to her parents home in misouri during the run up , and ended up finishing just one hour before the race 's 17 hour cut off time . sister buder says it was here she first earned her iron nun title , but it was not until seven years later , when she finished the ironman canada race in 16 hours 59 minutes , that she become the overall global ironman record holder . asked how she trains for these triathlons , she says she runs to church every day and bikes 40 miles to swim in a lake near her home . she also jogs to her regular visits at the local jail , where she reads scriptures to inmates an activity which she says makes her feel so blessed to come home from . as for her diet , sister buder sticks to a mostly raw diet of fruits and vegetables , but incorporates carbs and protein powder into her meals , and she says she listens to what her body tells her it needs . i love the feeling i get when i whiz past people younger than me and they say , i want to be like you when i get to your age well , not entirely . the keen athlete admits she fractured her pelvis in a recent bike accident , but as well as water jogging at the ymca while she heals , she also hits the elliptical trainer probably against her doctor 's wishes . it is clearly a hobby she feels she cannot let go i do not know what i would do without running she exclaims . i love the feeling i get when i whiz past people younger than me and they say , i want to be like you when i get to your age and while she cherishes the opportunity to be a source of inspiration to others , claiming she races now mostly out of camaraderie , she does have certain fellow runners place her a little too high on the pedestal . treat me differently because i am a sister , she confesses . i feel like they think i am supposed to be their mascot and pray for good weather for us or something . not every race she has run has been a blessing however . sister buder ran in the 2013 boston marathon , where she recalls receiving an all together spooky omen in the hours before the bombing disasters struck . book deal : sister buder has written an inspiring book about her life the morning before the race , she was approached by a police officer who gave her his card and told her to call him if she ever needed anything . thinking little of it , she thanked the officer and held on to his card . a little later , a young boy approached her out of the blue and said he thought she should memorize the phone number on the card . she took the child 's advice . as she was approaching the 21 st mile of the race , she heard sirens and noticed fire engines begin to rush to the scene . panicked and numb , and u.s.re of what to do or where to go , she remembered the police officer 's number and called it the officer navigated her out of her confused and terrified state and she says that while her heart broke for those injured and killed , it taught her a valuable lesson about paying attention to her instincts . asked what she would say to her younger self if she could go back in time , sister buder says her advice would be to live by what you do rather than what you say and to always focus on how old you feel not how old you actually are . finally : patience she says , admitting that she still struggles to slow down , and to stop and smell the roses .:==:sister buder is known as the iron nun and only ran her first race when she was 48 . trained for triathlons on her nephew 's bike and jogs to church . opens up about the eerie omen she received before running the 2013 boston marathon .

when ian bell was dropped after two matches of england s tour to sri lanka before christmas , his world cup place was very much in jeopardy . now he has confirmed his role at the top of the order in emphatic fashion . not only did bell s magnificent 187 at the manuka oval on wednesday spoil australian prime minister tony abbott s annual cricketing party but it proved that perhaps england can play modern one day cricket after all . the giddy heights of 391 for six against a far from shabby prime minister s xi was certainly a statement from an england side who seemed to arrive in australia hoping once again that everything would be all right on the world cup night . ian bell hits out on his way to a magnificent 187 as england beat a prime minister 's xi in canberra bell 's innings dispelled any thoughts that he does not deserve a place in england 's world cup line up nothing more so than the contribution of bell , who was controversially handed alastair cook s opening role here ahead of alex hales on the far from convincing evidence of just three centuries in 150 odis . bell is england s classiest test batsman but he has never been as comfortable in coloured clothing and his selection seemed to provide more ammunition to those who feel england remain stuck in the one day dark ages . this , then , was vindication for the selectors , who ditched their captain cook before coming here but not their game plan , and provided a little hope that this world cup mission might not necessarily be doomed to failure . the opener 's enormous score helped england reach a total of 391 for six at the manuka oval bell is congratulated by james taylor after reaching his century against the prime minister 's xi of course i was worried about my world cup place , admitted bell afterwards . the squad had to be narrowed down and a lot of people have come in and done well.com ing out here i didn t know where i was going to bat or even if i was going to start , so it was nice to have a good chat with eoin morgan when he told me i was going to get first crack . the sight of glenn maxwell , far from certain of a place in australia s world cup side , smashing 136 off 89 balls in reply ensured england did not get too carried away by their sudden show of batting strength . another notable mention must go to chris woakes who managed to complete a stunning keepy up catch to dismiss lega siaka . chris woakes fumbles a catch in the field during the prime minister 's xi clash in canberra on wednesday the 25 year old keeps his eye on the ball as it rebounds off his thigh after a wayward shot from lega siaka woakes manages to flick the ball with his feet back towards his grasp all in one motion the 25 year old fumbled siaka 's attempt for a boundary as the ball rebounded off his thigh and looked destined to be a missed chance in the field . however woakes was able to flick the ball with his feet back towards his hands in one swift motion to complete an impressive recovery to add an extra gloss to the victory . more will become clear once england have faced australia and india in the tri series , which begins tomorrow , but for now they can be satisfied with just about the perfect batting display even if their bowling here was not so effective . england want bell to bat through an innings while others , notably his partner moeen ali , attack around him and the plan was executed spectacularly by the openers and a worthy accomplice in james taylor . woakes completes his remarkable recovery and catch to help dismiss lega siaka off chris jordan 's bowling moeen said ahead of this final warm up game that he would carry on being aggressive and he was as good as his word as he smacked 71 off 49 balls , including six fours in one frenetic nine ball spell . bell , meanwhile , moved to his hundred at just about a run a ball before accelerating to england s highest individual score in a one day match , hitting three sixes and 20 fours while consigning hales very much to the subs bench . one thing i ve probably been guilty of when i ve opened in the past is getting to 60 or 70 and not going on , said bell . but i enjoyed myself and if i can do that a couple more times it will be good for the team . it s nice to have a good start but the big stuff starts on friday . stuart broad celebrates with his england team mates after dismissing jason behrendorff glenn maxwell led the fightback for the prime minister 's xi , hitting 136 off 89 balls matt condon is bowled by james tredwell not pictured for 19 runs as wicketkeeper jos buttler looks on only when he had reached 68 did bell offer a semblance of a chance — maxwell doing well to get a hand to a low drive — before guiding england to their equal highest score in a 50 over game , matching the 391 they smashed against bangladesh at trent bridge in the heady summer of 2005 . taylor is another batsman who looked a long way from a world cup place not so long ago but he came into the england side in sri lanka when cook was suspended and has made the most of his unexpected opportunity . the biggest compliment that can be paid to bell and taylor is that they moved through the gears without fuss and as effortlessly as any of the leading exponents of the modern twenty20 driven 50 over game . they added 141 in 24 overs , taylor hitting 71 off 77 balls , as england impressively followed up the 364 they had scored in their opening tour match here in the australian capital against rather more modest opposition . england 's james taylor hits out during his innings of 71 off 79 balls moeen ali offered strong support for bell with an attacking 71 runs off 49 balls when england stood at 200 for one after 30 overs , a score of 400 did look on the cards and their failure to fully do themselves justice looked as if it might cost them dear when maxwell set off in hot pursuit . the man known as the big show in these parts is certainly a destructive performer and here he came close to taking apart a one dimensional england attack lacking jimmy anderson , who is being eased back into competitive action . if maxwell , one of two australian world cup players along with pat cummins in the pm s side , had stayed for another five overs , england would have been in trouble . but once stuart broad had him caught at point , the home side had too big a mountain to climb . they finished 60 short on a day of 722 runs , jos buttler having earlier taking a spectacular running catch to dismiss captain chris rogers , and now england will travel to sydney to take on australia with just a little hope in their heart . australian prime minister tony abbott joins captains eoin morgan and chris rogers for the toss moeen ali celebrates with jos buttler after taking the wicket of peter handscomb for 16 runs maxwell celebrates reaching his century his innings of 136 was not quite enough for the pm 's xi .:==:england beat prime minister 's xi

two former top leaders in cambodia 's notorious khmer rouge , which ruled the southeast asian country between 1975 and 1979 , were found guilty of crimes against humanity by a specially convened cambodian court thursday . before the verdict , only one person had been brought to justice over one of the 20 th century 's great atrocities . nuon chea , the former deputy secretary of the communist party of kampuchea , and khieu samphan , the one time president of democratic kampuchea both received life sentences . nuon chea , 88 , known as brother number two , and khieu samphan , 83 , known as brother number four , were expressionless as the verdict was read . they were found guilty of the following : crimes against humanity , of extermination , murder , political persecution , and other inhumane acts comprising forced transfer , forced disappearances and attacks against human dignity committed within the territory of cambodia between 17 april 1975 and december 1977 . the chamber finds that as a consequence of the crimes of which the accused have been convicted , the civil parties and a very large number of additional victims have suffered immeasurable harm , including physical suffering , economic loss , loss of dignity , psychological trauma , and grief arising from the loss of family members and close relations , a judge said in the ruling . the men were taken into custody after their arrest in 2007 . the defendants can appeal the judgment , and victor koppe , part of nuon chea 's defense team , indicated that they would be seeking to exercise that right . the defense team for khieu samphan also said they would appeal the verdict . the charges were heard in phnom penh in the extraordinary chambers in the courts of cambodia a special united nations backed tribunal that was formed in 2006 to prosecute senior khmer rouge leaders and other regime figures responsible for especially heinous acts . amnesty international welcomed the result as an important step towards justice . this long awaited ruling is an important step towards justice for the victims of the khmer rouge period and highlights the importance of addressing impunity , said the organization 's deputy asia pacific director rupert abbott . but the earlier refusal of senior cambodian government officials to give evidence , as well as allegations of political interference in other eccc cases , is troubling and raises concerns around the fairness of the proceedings and respect for victims right to hear the full truth regarding the alleged crimes . amnesty also welcomed the court 's decision to endorse 11 reparation projects for victims . however , much more must also be done by the government of cambodia towards repairing the harm suffered by victims . a timeline of the khmer rouge regime and its aftermath a bloody regime the two men were senior leaders in the khmer rouge regime , which ruled cambodia between 1975 and 1979 . during that time at least 1.7 million people about a quarter of the cambodian population are believed to have died from forced labor , starvation and execution , as the movement ruthlessly executed its radical social engineering policies aimed at creating a purely agrarian society . an ongoing struggle for justice after khmer rouge the pair were tried in a hybrid tribunal officially an ad hoc cambodian court with international participation uses both cambodian and international judges and staff employed by the you . n in order to ensure the trials are conducted to international standards and to mitigate against the weakness of the cambodian legal system . this judgment represents an important milestone for cambodians and victims around the world , a joint statement from the office of the co prosecutors read . for 35 years the leaders of the regime evaded justice for some of some of the most brutal and cruel crimes ever committed . around 3,500 victims participated in the trial , as witnesses giving evidence , observers and in seeking reparations . the trial has allowed cambodia to reset its moral compass , which was destroyed by the accused 40 years ago , the statement said . until today 's conclusion , the eccc had delivered only one verdict in its eight years of existence . in the eccc 's case 001 , kaing guek eav , commonly known by his alias , duch , was sentenced to life imprisonment following his 2010 convictions for war crimes , crimes against humanity , murder and torture . he was the commandant of the notorious tuol sleng s 21 prison in phnom penh , where more than 14,000 people died . the verdicts on thursday in the case known as 00201 was the first time that senior leaders of the regime have faced justice . recognizing the limitations of the court , the eccc 's legal communications officer lars olsen told cnn : we cannot prosecute everyone who committed a crime 35 years ago . that is the nature of international justice . disappointment some victims of the crimes of the regime were not satisfied by the verdict . theary seng , founding president of the center for cambodian civic education , told cnn that the scope of the court , and the trial , by focusing on the forced movements , and the murder of 250 lon nol the previous prime minister officials and troops at tuol po chrey shortly after the regime was installed was insufficient . cambodia has not got to the heart of the genocide . it is a missed opportunity . it completely missed the mark . what have we seen from $200 million and eight years of the existence of the eccc ? it is really a disservice to the other cambodian victims . she did allow that the trial was the beginning of a process of healing and that it would serve as a catalyst for conversations in cambodia about our past . seng was just seven years old in 1978 when both her parents were killed after several months in prison . it was at a time when the leadership was , she said , in extreme paranoia and even party cadres were being purged . her mother was taken from the cell she shared with her children and other families , and tiptoed to her death to avoid waking up seng and her younger brother . the tragedy of my story is that it is so common , she said . it stays with us how can it not ? read more : see places where cambodia 's shocking past is on show .:==:two top leaders of cambodia 's 1975 to 79 khmer rouge regime found

deeper underground . nearby tectonic boundaries such as that between eurasia and africa can induce tremors in smaller fault lines like the ones in the uk 27 february 2008 magnitude 5.2 – lincolnshire02 april 19905.1 shropshire07 june 19316.1 – north sea09 november 18525.3 – caernarvon6 april 15805.8 – dover straits if you look at your hand , imagine the main lines as a major tectonic boundary , glenn ford , a seismologist at the bgs , explains to mailonline . between these are little lines , and if you gently squeeze your hand you see that even these smaller lines move back and forwards . while today s earthquake was large for the uk , tremors are a common and largely unnoticed occurrence across the rest of the world . it is estimated that 17,000 to 20,000 earthquakes of this size occur every year in the world . however , seismologists think that a larger one could strike the mainland uk one day and because significant damage . this particular one was 3.5 which in uk terms is quite significant , says ford . we maybe get one or two a year of that size . we had a 4.1 in the bristol channel back on the 20 th of february . they re not like buses they come when they want , but statistically we don t get many of this size . it is thought that millions of years ago the uk could have been situated over a major fault line such as the san andreas fault , pictured at carrizo plain national monument in california , usa for residents of rutland , the tremors proved to be because for some alarm . within half an hour of the first quake striking , the bgs had received around 140 calls from people who had felt the tremors . according to the bgs , an earthquake has to reach a magnitude of 4.5 before it can be expected to do any damage . emergency services have not reported any casualties or damage to property . among those who felt yesterday 's tremor was former english rugby union player austin healey . he tweeted : we ve just had an earthquake in oakham . the house was shaking for about 10 secs . louise warren , 40 , was getting four year old son adam ready for school when it struck . ms warrwen , of stamford , lincolnshire , said : the shaking sound started quite suddenly and my electric toothbrush fell from the shelf into my sink . it felt like a lorry going past my house but about ten times louder . there was a second shake soon after the first one stopped . i was not too scared because i remember when we had a tremor here about eight years ago . my son was a bit frightened because he would never felt anything like it before . but he is a boy , so he did think it was pretty cool . a british geological survey chart shows the tremors from the first earthquake that hit rutland shortly after 7 am yesterday before the second earthquake , a magnitude 3.5 , struck today the spike in the seismology readings can clearly be seen when the first earthquake hit yesterday the reason for two earthquakes occurring so close to each other might be the result of stresses building up in the faults . magnitude 1 and 2 – not felt by people , detected by instruments . magnitude 3 – silght tremor felt by people indoors , likened to a passing lorry . magnitude 4 – can crack walls , disturb trees . magnitude 5 – moves furniture , damages poorly built buildings . magnitude 6 – moderate to major damage , chimneys and walls collapse . magnitude 7 – major damage to all buildings , ground cracks , landslides can occur . magnitude 8 – total destruction , waves can be seen travelling through the ground . in other parts of the world they wouldn t be talking about this , says ford . the tremor is very , very small compared to the quakes we see in areas of high seismic activity such as greece . for us 90 per cent of earthquakes are unnoticed , but when do happen we get alarmed . the public is not calibrated to them , maybe because people think they don t actually happen . ford says this one was probably more noticeable as well because many people are off work for the easter holiday . this one happened at a good time today for people to feel it they are lying down in an ideal position to feel earthquakes , very small tremors that people would never expect to feel . if you look at what people describe it s like a large lorry going past . an earthquake of this size can go unnoticed up in the highlands , or if it happens at a time of day where people are busy or in road traffic . many people today also realise another happened yesterday , so they are more aware . people are looking out for them now , and in shops and supermarkets they ll be saying “oh , did you feel the earthquake ?” to each other . sensitive equipment is able to measure tiny tremors unnoticed by the public in the uk scientists from columbia university claim fracking could because powerful earthquakes capable of destroying buildings as the process of extracting gas weakens fault lines deep underground . american geologists said that a domino effect of quakes could be caused by intense pressure on fault lines created by hydraulic fracturing , combined with seismic activity thousands of miles away . the columbia university scientists maintain that powerful earthquakes can trigger swarms of minor quakes near waste water injection wells like those used for in oil and gas recovery . they say a recent surge in u.s. oil and gas production using vast amounts of water to crack open rocks and release natural shale gas has been linked to an increase in small to moderate induced earthquakes in five states . seismologists from the university have identified three quakes in oklahoma , colorado and texas that they believe were triggered at injection well sites by a major earthquake a long distance away . the discovery , published in the journal science by one of the world 's leading seismology labs , threatens to make fracking even more controversial . a joint uk study of hydraulic fracturing by the royal society and the royal academy of engineering said that fracking can be managed effectively in the uk as long as operational best practices are implemented and robustly enforced through regulation . the experts also said that earth tremors induced by hydraulic fracturing are likely to be of a smaller magnitude than the uk naturally experiences or than is related to coal mining activities . the biggest earthquake on record to hit the uk was a 6.1 back in 1931 . fortunately this one hit offshore and didn t because much damage on the mainland , but ford says there is the possibility that one of this size could still hit the mainland uk we re quite a distance from immediate fault lines , like the mid atlantic ridge running up to iceland . but we do have a major plate tectonic boundary between the eurasian plate and the african plate . the african plate is rubbing up on the eurasian plate , so that causes stresses that build up on existing fault lines the uk has . some could be a few metres long , some are long , but over time stresses build up perhaps historically many millions of years ago they could have been more active . i m sure there were larger earthquakes at some time . earthquakes occur when tectonic plates rub together . for places like the uk , we experience tremors from smaller fault lines that are susceptible to these larger plate movements when these might occur though , or why these two were localised in rutland , remains a mystery . there is a possibility one of that size can hit the mainland uk , ford continues . the unusual feature of earthquakes is we don t know where they might occur . we don t know why it was localised in rutland . there could be faults underground that we don t know of in other parts of the world with earthquakes they don t know of all the fault lines . there could be lots of blind fault lines , we ve got a long way to go to understand these processes through seismology .:==:a magnitude 3.5 earthquake has struck rutland again in the east midlands . the tremors were felt at 7:50 am today , just 24 hours after the last one . region has now been hit by two earthquakes in quick succession . these types of earthquake are themselves small and common in the world . but seismologists warn there could be hidden fault lines under the uk these could lead to larger earthquakes occurring on the mainland in future .

an american health official has warned the deadly ebola virus still has the upper hand in the outbreak that has killed more than 1,400 people in west africa . during a visit to liberia on tuesday , dr tom frieden , director of the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention , issued the stark warning but pledged that experts would continue to try and halt the spread of the infection . liberia along with sierra leone and guinea have been hardest hit by the outbreak and nigeria has also confirmed they too have cases but officials there have expressed optimism the virus can be controlled . people gather around a man suspected of dying from the ebola virus , in one of the main streets on the outskirts of the city centre of monrovia in liberia liberian security forces with riot gear stop people from leaving the west point area , that has been hardest hit by the ebola virus which is spreading in monrovia a man , left , rents out his wheelbarrow and moves food goods for people in the west point area in the liberian capital people wait for liberian security forces to allow them to deliver foodstuff to friends and family members in the west point area speaking at a meeting attended by the liberian president ellen johnson sirleaf , dr frieden said : lots of hard work is happening . lots of good things are happening . but the virus still has the upper hand . ebola does not spread by mysterious means . we know how it spreads . so we have the means to stop it from spreading , but it requires tremendous attention to every detail . it comes as medical staff in protective clothing transported a patient infected with the ebola virus from an aircraft to an ambulance in hamburg in nothern germany . the world health organisation employee who has contracted ebola is the first patient with the virus to be treated in the country , officials said . a plane carrying a patient infected with the deadly ebola virus lands in hamburg in germany , where they will receive treatment an ambulance drove on to the tarmac to collect the patient , who was greeted by health workers wearing protective suits the senegalese epidemiologist who was infected in sierra leone was to be taken to an isolation ward of the uke university hospital in hamburg . it comes as liberia has now resorted to stringent measures to try to halt ebola 's spread but frustration has mounted over the slow collection of bodies from neighborhoods in the capital monrovia . a group of residents even attached plastic ties to the wrists and ankles of one suspected ebola victim and dragged his corpse to a busy street . the patient is a senegalese epidemiologist , who was infected while working in the west african country of sierra leone the patient was taken by ambulance to to the uke university hospital in hamburg to receive treatment authorities have decreed that all the dead must be collected by government health workers and cremated because contact with bodies can transmit the virus . there is no proven treatment for ebola , so health workers primarily focus on isolating the sick . a small number of patients have received an experimental drug called zmapp . the london hospital treating a british nurse infected in sierra leone , william pooley , said he is now receiving the drug . it was unclear where the doses for mr pooley came from as the california based maker of zmapp has said its supplies are exhausted . people gather as the await a truck with food stuff from the world food programme , wfp , before they enter the west point area liberian security forces patrol the entrance to the area that has been hardest hit by the ebola virus spreading , which has claimed more than 1,400 lives in west africa two americans , a spaniard and three health workers in liberia have received zmapp . it is unclear if the drug is effective . the americans have been released from the hospital , but the spaniard died , as did a liberian doctor . meanwhile in nigeria , two more ebola patients were declared to have recovered and were released from hospital , health minister onyebuchi chukwu confirmed . five people have died of the disease in the country , while a total of seven have recovered . one person remains in the hospital in an isolation ward , chukwu added . meanwhile , the world health organisation has announced that it is pulling out its team from the eastern sierra leonean city of kailahun , where an epidemiologist working with the organisation was recently infected . daniel kertesz , the organization 's representative in the country , said that the team was exhausted and that the added stress of a colleague getting sick could increase the risk of mistakes . the ebola virus has the upper hand in an outbreak that has killed more than 1,400 people in west africa , a top american health official has said also , canadian health officials said in a statement that they would evacuate a three member mobile laboratory team in sierra leone after people in their hotel were diagnosed with ebola . the outbreak is the largest on record . doctors took a long time to identify it in a region where people are highly mobile . it has spread to densely populated areas , and many people have resisted or hid from treatment . the disease has overwhelmed the already shaky health systems in some of the world 's poorest countries . according to who , the ebola outbreak has killed over half of the more than 2,600 people sickened . the you . n agency said an unprecedented 240 health care workers have been infected . a water vendor , centre , reads a warning on the door of a vehicle , left , regarding the deadly ebola virus in monrovia , liberia the agency attributed the high number of infections among health workers to a shortage of protective gear , improper use of such equipment , and a shortage of staff to treat the tremendous influx of patients . in the current outbreak , as many as 90,000 protective suits will be needed every month , according to jorge castilla , an epidemiologist with the european union commission 's department for humanitarian aid . he did not say how many suits were lacking . the outbreak also desperately needs more workers to trace the people the sick have come into contact with and more centers where patients can be screened for the disease in a way that contains any ebola infections , castilla added . meanwhile an ebola outbreak emerged over the weekend in congo , though experts say it is not related to the west african epidemic . doctors without borders , which is running many of the treatment centres in the west africa outbreak , said it is sending experts and supplies to congo but warned that the charity 's resources are stretched thin .:==:dr tom frieden issued warning while on a visit to ebola infected countries . says the deadly virus still has the upper hand in the outbreak . but added that there is optimism that the condition can be controlled . ebola has killed more than 1,400
