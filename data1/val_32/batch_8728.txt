high in a rugged , mountainous region in myanmar 's north , the country 's army remains locked in a conflict that seems to contradict the image of a nation committed to abandoning its brutal past . days after a government ordered ceasefire on january 19 , clashes were reported between burmese soldiers and the kachin independence army around the town of laiza on the chinese border . the myanmar government said its troops were ordered to fire only in self defense , but the kachin independence organization , the kia 's political arm , claimed it was under attack laiza is the headquarters of the kia and the kio . around 20,000 people live there , and thousands more are sheltering in temporary camps around the town after being driven from their homes , according to human rights groups and other reports . people who live in laiza , they are standing by to flee . every day they hear bombing and the noise of guns . the government is saying that it is stopped the offensive , but the reality in the kachin area it has not stopped , and the fighting and the offensive is ongoing , moon nay li , coordinator for the kachin women 's association told cnn on tuesday . though based in thailand , moon nay li said she would been speaking with people in laiza who were afraid for their future . she said they were digging holes to shelter from the shelling , and were desperate for the fighting to stop . why has fighting intensified now ? in a statement dated january 18 , the myanmar government said that it had requested back up from the air force to ensure accurate hitting of kio kia targets after repeated attacks on convoys seeking to resupply an outpost near laiza . it accused the kia of blasting roads and bridges , attacking troops and recruiting and abducting civilians to aid its fight . despite the government 's self defense claims , matthew smith , a consultant to human rights watch , told cnn the government appeared to have recently stepped up attacks on kachin fighters , possibly in an attempt to gain more ground and leverage in any future peace talks . some of the strategic outposts that the burmese government has been attacking over the last several weeks are strategic to the protection of laiza so i think that appears to be the target , said smith , who wrote a damning report for hrw on the conflict between the two sides called untold miseries wartime abuses and forced displacement in burma 's kachin state , which was released in march 2012 . how long have they been fighting ? the myanmar army and the kia which formed more than 50 years ago have been trading shots since a series of incidents brought a sudden end to 17 year ceasefire in june 2011 . smith said tensions rose after leaders of the kio were unable to participate in the november 2010 election the first vote to be held in myanmar in 20 years . according to smith 's report , the burmese army launched a major military offensive on june 9 , 2011 , to which the kia rapidly responded by blowing up bridges , planting land mines and ambushing military convoys . at the time , conservationists claimed the two sides were fighting for control of a multi billion dollar hydropower dam project on the taping river , one of several being built in the region . however , dams are not the only source of tension in the area , smith said . it is also rich in mineral deposits , including the jade mines of hpakant , a source of some of the world 's most valuable stones . and pipelines snake through the state delivering lucrative oil and gas to china . how has the world responded ? news of the escalation of attacks in kachin has raised concerns outside the country as the international community keenly watches myanmar 's transition to democracy from a military regime . we are obviously deeply troubled by the increased violence , u.s. state department spokeswoman victoria nuland said in a news conference in early january . later , china urged both sides to exercise maximum restraint after a bomb landed about 500 meters over the chinese border on january 15 . we believe that talks are the only correct solution to the north myanmar conflict and expect all related parties to seek a ceasefire and start negotiations , said foreign ministry spokesman hong lei on january 22 . the united nations welcomed president thein sein 's calls for a january 19 ceasefire but the secretary general 's special adviser on myanmar , vijay nambiar , said it did not want renewed tensions to undermine the overall direction of reform and transformation in the country or adversely affect the positive international atmosphere that had been generated so far . since coming to power in march 2011 , sein has won praise for steering the country on the path of reform , easing media restrictions , granting amnesty to political prisoners and opening up the political system to competing parties . how committed is the government to peace ? days after the apparent failure of the ceasefire , sein reiterated that he wanted the fighting to stop . i have ordered the tatmadaw myanmar 's military and other relevant government agencies to seek a peaceful solution to the conflict , he told myanmar 's first development cooperation forum on january 21 . he also suggested that the kio would need to reciprocate in a similar way . the kio is the only one of 10 armed ethnic groups in myanmar that has not yet agreed a long term ceasefire with the government . talks would start soon with the other ethnic groups , sein said , as he again extended an invitation to the kia to join the process . my government will continue to do everything necessary to turn ceasefire agreements into lasting peace , he said . it is very important to create job opportunities in order to improve socio economic conditions of internally displaced people and ceasefire groups , he added . how have civilians been affected by fighting ? since june 2011 , tens of thousands of kachins have been terrorized by renewed fighting , according to hrw . more than 90,000 people have been forced from their homes , according to the latest estimates . however , the exact number of internally displaced people or idps as they are known is hard to confirm because the government has limited access to the region . the lack of access has worried aid agencies who say tens of thousands of people are being denied vital care . the government feels it is u.s.fe so they are not granting access , said maria guevara , medecins san frontiere 's humanitarian representative for asean . we have tried to support some of the areas with drug supplies but the roads that we have used in the past are generally inaccessible , because that is where the fighting usually takes place , so it is been difficult to resupply . she called on the government to allow humanitarian agencies independent and neutral access to affected areas , while smith warned of a looming humanitarian emergency . what are the chances of a long term ceasefire ? there are no easy solutions to resolve the unrest in kachin . it dates back to the early 1960 s when the kio and kia were established to protect the interests of the kachin people against the influence of the central government . the kio still has administrative control over most of kachin state , providing schooling , teacher training colleges , a police service , a tv station , newspapers , libraries and hospitals , according to the free kachin campaign website . hrw says the latest offensive has deepened divisions between the kachins and the government , which threatens to spill over into other ethnic groups . you have an entire population of ethnic kachin who for the most part right now are very bitter towards the burmese government and that is going to be a serious problem , not only for kachin state but the other ethnic nationalities throughout the country right now who are negotiating peace agreements . they are taking all this into consideration so this could pose a serious problem for long term peace in the country , he said .:==:renewed fighting reported in kachin despite government ceasefire order . both myanmar government and the kia trade accusations of attacks . fighting started in june 2011 after a 17 year ceasefire was broken . kia is the only one of 10 armed ethnic groups that has not agreed a ceasefire .

the extent to which the premier league overshadows english football s ruling body will be demonstrated when the fa publish their annual accounts . the figures for the year ending july 2014 put the fa s turnover at £332 million , with a gross profit of £261 m . these are big numbers and compare favourably with the rfu , who turned over £152.2 m during the same period . but they are dwarfed by the £5.1 billion the premier league gained for their domestic tv rights over three years , with more billions to come from overseas deals . the fa 's £261 million profit is dwarfed by the new premier league mega deal , worth £5.1 billion the fa will have to change general secretary alex horne 's review , after he wrote about the signing of a sponsor for the 2014 to 15 fa cup , which never happened sky sports paid the premier league an average of £11.1 m per game — the same amount the fa brought in from their combined annual increase in broadcasting , sponsorship and licensing . meanwhile , the fa will have to alter former general secretary alex horne s review , written last november , contained in the accounts . he wrote about the signing of a sponsor for the 2014 to 15 fa cup which never happened . horne also singled out sian massey as a leading match official setting a global standard . she was at the women s under 20 world cup but hasn t been an assistant referee for a pl game this season — first because of injury and now because she is pregnant . more evidence that uefa are orchestrating the three strong presidential challenge to sepp blatter came with their strategist mike lee

a dangerous precedent by allowing struggling england one day captain eoin morgan to play in the whole of the indian premier league . his £156,000 deal with sunrisers hyderabad means he will miss the one day international against ireland on may 8 when he would have been due to lead the side — form permitting — and that means england will need to pick another skipper , devaluing the position . it s still questionable business as usual at fifa with the extraordinary early sale of the 2026 world cup tv rights to fox in the usa without a tender — to the fury of espn and other rival networks . the usa are favourites to host that tournament and delaying selling the rights until the location is decided could have brought in far more money . but fox have been the biggest opponents of the switch to a winter world cup in qatar and this deal will ensure they don t take legal action . fifa have sold the rights to the 2026 world cup in america to fox to the fury of espn and other rivals judo thrown

secretary of state hillary clinton has extended an olive branch to pakistan 's prime minister in america 's latest bid to address strained relations between the two countries . it comes exactly one week after the nato bombing that killed 24 pakistani soldiers along the afghanistan border in an apparent case of mistaken identity . following the attack , prime minister yousaf raza gilani said his county is re evaluating its relationship with the united states . peace offering : u.s. secretary of state hillary clinton spoke with pakistani prime minister yousaf raza gilani to offer her condolences for the unintended deaths of 24 pakistani soldiers but on saturday clinton spoke with the pakistani leader to express condolences to the soldiers families and to the pakistani people . a statement from the u.s. state department said clinton once again expressed condolences to the families of the soldiers and to the pakistani people for the tragic and unintended loss of life . she reiterated america 's respect for pakistan 's sovereignty and commitment to working together in pursuit of shared objectives on the basis of mutual interest and mutual respect . she had hoped pakistan would attend an international conference on afghanistan scheduled for monday in germany . the country 's attendance at the conference had been considered essential to ensure stability in the region stands a chance . but a government official told the afp news agency : the cabinet has decided not to attend the bonn meeting . pakistan refused to join in the u.s. investigation of the bombing and has moved to shut down supply lines the u.s. uses to get food , fuel and equipment to troops in afghanistan . protesters burn a u.s. flag in multan yesterday in response to the nato air strikes . it was today claimed that nato forces may have been lured into attacking friendly pakistani border posts by the taliban last week u.s. military reports suggested nato forces may have been lured into attacking friendly pakistani border posts in a calculated manoeuvre by the taliban . the attack which pakistan claims went on for almost two hours and continued even after soldiers had pleaded with forces to stop marked the deadliest friendly fire incident with pakistan since the afghanistan war began . a joint u.s. afghan patrol was attacked by the taliban last weekend . while pursuing the taliban in the poorly marked border area , the patrol is said to have mistaken one of the pakistan troop outposts for a militant encampment and called in a nato gunship and attack helicopters to open fire . u.s. officials , speaking on condition of anonymity , claim the reports suggest the taliban may have deliberately tried to provoke a cross border fire fight that would set back fragile partnerships between the u.s. and nato forces and pakistani soldiers at the ill defined border . student protesters shout anti american slogans during a protest in peshawar today . there is widespread anger across pakistan following the air strikes the incident sent the perpetually difficult u.s. pakistan relationship into a tailspin . general james mattis , head of u.s. central command , announced he has appointed brigadier general stephen clark , an air force special operations officer , to lead the probe into the incident . brigadier general clark has been ordered to include input from the nato led forces in afghanistan , as well as representatives from the afghan and pakistani governments . according to the u.s. military records described to news agency the associated press , the joint u.s. and afghan patrol requested back up after being hit by mortar and small arms fire by taliban militants . before responding , the joint u.s. afghan patrol first checked with the pakistani army , which reported it had no troops in the area , the military account said . some two hours later , still hunting the insurgents who had by then apparently fled in the direction of pakistani border posts the u.s. commander spotted what he thought was a militant encampment , with heavy weapons mounted on tripods . the joint patrol called for the air strikes at around 2.21 am local time , not realising the encampment was apparently the pakistani border post . heavily guarded : the 24 pakistani soldiers who were killed in the attacks are buried yesterday salute : pakistani soldiers march among the rows of coffins during yesterday 's ceremony records show the aerial response included apache attack helicopters and an ac 130 gunship . u.s. officials are working on the assumption the taliban chose the location for the first attack to create confusion and draw u.s. and pakistani forces into firing on each other , it is claimed . at the white house , spokesman jay carney said president barack obama considers the pakistani deaths a tragedy , and said the administration is determined to investigate . the pentagon released a four page memo from general mattis directing brigadier general clark to determine what happened , which units were involved , which ones did or did not cross the border , how the operation was coordinated , and what caused the deaths and injuries . brigadier general clark must also develop recommendations about how border operations could be improved . his final report must be submitted by december 23 . the details of the air strike emerged as aftershocks were last night reverberating across the u.s. military and diplomatic landscape , threatening communications and supply lines for the afghan war and the success of an upcoming international conference . while u.s. officials expressed regret and sympathy over the cross border incident , they are not acknowledging blame , amid conflicting reports about who fired first . attack : nato helicopters similar to this one opened fire on the pakistani army checkpoint close to its border with afghanistan in recent weeks , military leaders had begun expressing some optimism that u.s. pakistan military cooperation along the border was beginning to improve . just two weeks ago , u.s. army major general daniel allyn told pentagon reporters that incidents of firing from pakistan territory had tapered off somewhat in recent weeks . pentagon press secretary george little last week stressed the need for a strong military relationship with pakistan . he said : the pakistani government knows our position on that , and that is we do regret the loss of life in this incident , and we are investigating it the military fallout began almost immediately . pakistan has blocked vital supply routes for u.s. led troops in afghanistan and demanded washington vacate a base used by american drones . pakistan ordered cia employees to mothball their drone operation at pakistan 's shamsi air base within two weeks , a senior pakistani official said . the officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters .:==:nato described the deaths as tragic and unintended . pakistan decides not to attend international talks on afghanistan in bonn .

a woman who shouted f the police as she cycled past officers in the street has been awarded a $100,000 settlement from a federal court because it violated her free speech . amy elizabeth barnes was arrested after screaming abuse , including cobb police suck , and sticking her middle finger up at deputies questioning a black man outside a store in marietta , georgia . the political activist was then placed in solitary confinement when she was taken into custody on easter sunday in 2012 . settlement : amy elizabeth barnes was arrested after screaming abuse , including cobb police suck , and sticking her middle finger up at deputies questioning a black man outside a store in marietta , georgia , in 2012 she then went to court saying her first amendment rights were violated while claiming she was maliciously prosecuted when she was jailed on charges of disorderly conduct and the use of abuse words to incite an immediate breach of the peace . a judge ruled that even though her language was offensive , in constituted political speech . cynthia counts , her lawyer , told the atlanta constitution journal : ms barnes comments to the police may have been offensive , but no one in the united states of america should be chased down and arrested for their free speech . the officers argued that it was a bad neighborhood and you shouldn t disrespect the police because it could create issues . judge melodie clayton said miss barnes had not confronted the officers when she shouted the abuse and instead rode away on her bicycle . in her judgement , she described how it was then that the cops stopped questioning the suspect and pursued her instead . activist : she went to court saying her first amendment rights were while violated claiming she was maliciously prosecuted . a judge said even though her language was offensive it constituted political speech she wrote : the evidence at trial showed that the defendant was not engaged in a face to face confrontation with the officers which tended to incite an immediate breach of the peace when the words were spoken . in addition , the word “su k”, used as an epithet , is now common enough in modern society that it cannot reasonably provoke a threat of violence . the defendant s other statement , “ the police , ” was a fleeting epithet that was insulting and inappropriate , but it did not create an immediate threat and danger of violence . the defendant s statements , although offensive to this court , clearly constitute political speech . in 2013 , the county solicitor also lost the criminal case against barnes .:==:amy elizabeth barnes was arrested in marietta , georgia , in april 2012 . shouted at two officers questioning a black man by a convenience store . political activist continued on her bike but then the officers pursued her . she was placed in solitary confinement while in custody . miss barnes said the arrest violated her first amendment rights . court said the language was offensive but constituted political speech .

an artificial heart has been transplanted into a patient for the first time in medical history , it was announced today . french medics said that a male patient was awake and responding well following wednesday s ground breaking operation at the georges pompidou hospital in paris . marcello conviti , head of the carmat biomedical firm , said : we are delighted with this first implant , although it is premature to draw conclusions given that a single implant has been performed and that we are in the early postoperative phase . surgeons in france have transplanted the first ever artificial heart , pictured , successfully into a patient french social affairs and health minister marisol touraine , left , and alain carpentier , surgeon and carmat co founder attend a news conference at the georges pompidou european hospital in paris mr conviti said the artificial heart , which is three times the weight of a real one , would beat for at least five years . heart assistance devices have frequently been used for patients waiting for transplants , but the new bioprosthetic device will replace the real heart it will help thousands of people who are die each year while waiting for a donor , including many in britain . surgeon alain carpentier said : it is about giving patients a normal social life with the least dependence on medication as possible . we ve already seen these types of device of this type but they had a relatively low autonomy . this heart will allow for more movement and less clotting . the study that is starting is being very closely watched in the medical field . this news brings great pride to france , said the marisol touraine , french health minister . it shows we are pioneers in healthcare , that we can invent , that we can carry an innovation that will also bring great hope to plenty of people . in 2005 surgeons in france performed the first face transplant , and they are always trying to push back research frontiers . the male patient is said to be awake and responding well following the operation at the georges pompidou hospital in paris developed by a team of engineers from airbus parent company eads , the artificial heart weighs 2 lb almost three times as much as an average healthy human heart . it is expected to cost around £150,000 if it is made widely available . the device mimics heart muscle contractions and contains sensors that adapt the blood flow to the patient 's moves . the artificial heart is powered by external , wearable lithium ion batteries . inside the heart , surfaces that come into contact with human blood are made partly from bovine tissue instead of synthetic materials such as plastic that can because blood clots . heart failure affects more men than women , and the size of the artificial heart means it can fit in 86 percent of men but only around 20 percent of women . but carmat says it can manufacture a smaller version to fit the smaller bodies of women as well as patients in india and china . the artifical organ replicates the heart muscles contractions to push blood around the body heart failure is when the organ is no longer able to pump blood around the body . it is commonly caused by coronary artery diseases and hypertension . almost half of patients die within a year of first being hospitalised with the condition . for those suffering the most severe form of heart failure a transplant is the only option . but only around 4,000 hearts are available around the world each year compared with around 100,000 people on the transplant list . research into the artificial heart began in the us in 1963 . it is a device which replaces the heart . it works by replicating the heart muscle to beat blood around the body , supplying other organs . in the past patients have had artificial hearts implanted as temporary measures , to bridge the gap until a live donor can be found .:==:male patient is responding well following the ground breaking operation at the georges pompidou hospital in paris . biomedical firm carmat said they are delighted with the first implant but added it is still very early stages . device , which is powered by an external battery , is three times the weight of a real organ and mimics the heart muscle contractions .

for years it has been a village synonymous with one of britain 's most famous cheeses . but while the cambridgeshire village of stilton may claim to be the home of the crumbly blue favourite , those who produce the cheese are bizarrely not allowed to use its famous name . a current european law ruling means stilton cheese can only be produced by seven dairies in leicestershire , derbyshire and nottinghamshire . tradition : cheese makes in stilton , cambridgeshire , have been banned from using the name for the famous cheese produced in their village famous : stilton makes the most of its association with the famous cheese , and villagers are hoping to gain official recognition from defra soon the ridiculous decision means that while the famous blue cheese can be made in stilton , it has to go by the name bell blue . now , after last year finally winning the right to produce stilton in their village at all , campaigners in cambridgeshire want the right to call their product by its proper name . the current dispute over stilton being able to use the cheese 's name in its own village stems in part from the historic blue 's history . historical evidence suggests a cream cheese was being made and sold in and around stilton in the late 17 th century . a recipe for stilton cheese was published in a newsletter by richard bradley in 1723 , but no details were given on its size , shape , or how long it was matured . in 1724 daniel defoe commented in his tour through the villages of england wales of stilton being famous for cheese and referred to the cheese as being the english parmesan . a later article by john lawrence in 1726 suggested that the perfect stilton should be about 7 inches in diameter , 8 inches in height and 18 lbs in weight . as stilton became a trading post between london and edinburgh , the cheese was said to be sold to passing traders . as demand for the cheese grew , its production moved to leicestershire and nottinghamshire . it was at this stage that the cheese 's trademark blue veins became a part of the product , as it also became semi hard blue cheese . on monday the village of stilton applied to defra for an extension of the protected designation of origin for the cheese to cover their parish . the village launched their campaign two days ago at the start of national stilton week 2012 , and will boost their efforts by adding the phrase original home of stilton cheese to a sign outside their village . stilton cheese is said by some to have got its name after being sold to travellers passing through the village in the 18 th century . officials in melton mowbray , leicestershire , however , say stilton was only a trade link and that the recipe was created in their county . stilton is officially recognised as coming from leicestershire , and can only be produced there and in its two neighbouring counties following the pdo in 1996 . liam mcgivern , landlord of the bell inn in stilton , makes a version of the cheese which until now he has had to call bell blue . he said that not being able to call the cheese stilton is embarrassing , especially given the tourist appeal that comes with the product . he said : we get people coming in all the time saying , oh , can you direct me to the cheese factory ? if you asked 99 per cent of the population where the cheese comes from , they would say stilton . the campaign in stilton has been created by various people and businesses in the village , and fronted by local historian richard landy . he told the peterborough evening telegraph : since first being announced at last year s stilton cheese rolling event , this campaign has continued to gather momentum . we have now fulfilled defra s requirements that we must be making the cheese , which we have been doing since 2011 and that it must be for commercial sale . they are the conditions that need to be satisfied before applying for an amendment to the pdo . matthew o callaghan , chairman of the melton mowbray food partnership , disputes whether blue stilton was ever made in the village of the same name . a spokesperson for defra said : to amend the geographical boundaries of an existing protected food , an applicant must first prove they are an interested party by showing they genuinely already make it commercially on a permanent , regular basis . we would then carefully consider an application and if the claim was justified we would hold a uk wide public consultation before making any decision . association : stilton has long enjoyed a link to the famous blue cheese , and even has an annual stilton cheese rolling event through the village landlord liam mcgivern makes a recipe that follows the stilton recipe , but under eu rules is forced to call it bell blue .:==:cambridgeshire village claims to be birthplace of famous cheese but cannot use its name . european law states stilton can only be produced in leicestershire , derbyshire and nottinghamshire .

the skeletons of a mother and her child buried side by side are among those which are to be excavated from an ancient burial ground after being disturbed during construction for london 's crossrail . archaeologists have started excavating 3,000 skeletons from bedlam burial ground , which is at the site of the new liverpool street station that will serve the cross london rail network . used from 1569 until at least 1738 , including during the great plague in 1665 , the burial site also known as bethlehem and the new churchyard was opened after graveyards around london started to overflow . it was situated in close proximity to bethlem royal hospital the first dedicated psychiatric institution in europe – and was used to bury london s poor and religious non conformists as well as inmates from the asylum . skeletons of a mother and child pictured above are among those which are to be excavated from the bedlam burial ground , which is the site for the new liverpool street station that will serve london 's crossrail network other skeletons at the burial site include that of a mother and her two children . most of the remains are unidentified since the site did not keep its own burial records when it was used between 1569 and 1738 archaeologists have started excavating 3,000 skeletons from the ancient bedlam burial ground these two adult skulls were among thousands uncovered at the bedlam burial ground , which was used during the great plague in 1665 . the remains will be removed over the next week by a team of archaeologists a team of 60 archaeologists will work in shifts , six days a week , to excavate the skeletons and gather any other remains at the burial site . the skeletons pictured above will then be reburied on consecrated ground the site , which was uncovered by crossrail workers who are in the process of building a new ticket hall above the burial ground , is thought to contain the remains of a former lord mayor of london , a notorious criminal and political activists . the skeletons will be excavated over the next four weeks by a team of 60 archaeologists who will work in shifts , six days a week . they will carefully remove the remains and record evidence for what may prove to be , in archaeological terms , london 's most valuable 16 th and 17 th century cemetery site . after the excavation , the workers will then dig through medieval marsh deposits and roman remains including a road that runs under the site , which has already yielded several interesting roman artefacts such as horseshoes and cremation urns . the skeletons will then be reburied on consecrated ground . archaeologists are expected to finish on site in september , after which construction will proceed on a new eastern ticket hall by contractor laing o rourke . jay carver , crossrail lead archaeologist , said : this excavation presents a unique opportunity to understand the lives and deaths of 16 th and 17 th century londoners . the bedlam burial ground spans a fascinating phase of london 's history , including the transition from the tudor period city into cosmopolitan early modern london . this is probably the first time a sample of this size from this time period has been available for archaeologists to study in london . bedlam was used by a hugely diverse population from right across the social spectrum and from different areas of the city . archaeologists at the new livepool street station are expected to finish on site in september the remains were uncovered during crossrail construction work , which is set to be completed by 2019 bones and skeletal remains could be seen at the bedlam burial site today as workers began excavating them the bedlam burial ground opened during london s response to the plague crisis in the 16 th century the burial site was the first in london which was not associated with a parish church and so many remains are unknown . workers could be seen carrying out excavations at the site today ahead of the crossrail work the crossrail project has already unearthed a number of exciting discoveries , including more than 10,000 artefacts at more than 40 construction sites . in 2013 , workers made an unexpected and fascinating discovery in tunnels underneath liverpool street station , where the historic river walbrook flows . the crossrail team unearthed about 20 roman skulls which were found buried in clusters in the sediment of the historic tributary . the crossrail team unearthed about 20 roman skulls in 2013 , which had been buried in clusters at bedlam working under the direction of archaeologists , the construction workers carefully removed the human skulls , as well as a collection of ancient roman pottery . for safety reasons the archaeologists had to leave the work to the tunnellers as the skulls were buried as deep as six metres below ground . the discovery of the skulls and pottery was made below the site of the historic bedlam burial ground . bedlam hospital was a psychiatric asylum and patients who died while at the hospital were buried in a cemetery first established in the 16 th century . historically , roman skulls have been found along the thames tributary walbrook during various excavations in the region . prior to the discovery of the roman skulls , workers also found about 4,000 skeletons buried in the eldon street area . these skeletons were found in august 2013 and were carefully removed during major archaeological excavations last year the archaeological excavations at liverpool street are being undertaken by museum of london archaeology on behalf of crossrail . scientific analysis of the remains will help provide new insights into the lives and deaths of early modern londoners . bedlam burial ground was established in 1569 to help parishes cope with overcrowding during outbreaks of the plague and other epidemics . as well as being used to bury those who were struck down with disease , it also became the site for those who passed away at the nearby bethlem royal hospital which is thought to have been the world 's first mental asylum . however , with mental patients showing no physical symptoms of illness , determining which of the remains belonged to those treated at the hospital will be near impossible for experts . earlier this year , crossrail led research identified the names and backgrounds of more than 5,000 people buried at the site . names include sir ambrose nicholas , who was lord mayor of london in 1575 , and dr john lamb also known as lam or lambe , an astrologer and advisor to the first duke of buckingham . scientific analysis of the remains will help provide new insights into the lives and deaths of londoners to date , the crossrail project has found more than 10,000 artefacts spanning many years of london 's past across more than 40 construction sites . pictured : workers have started excavation work at the bedlam site the archaeological excavations at liverpool street are being undertaken by museum of london archaeology preliminary excavations at the liverpool street station site have already uncovered more than 400 skeletons lamb was said to have been stoned to death by an

noted in the diaries of samuel pepys in january 1661 . to date , crossrail has found more than 10,000 artefacts spanning many years of london 's past across more than 40 construction sites . it is the uk 's largest archaeology project . preliminary excavations at the liverpool street site in 2013 and 2014 have already uncovered more than 400 skeletons and numerous artefacts . after the skeletaon excavations , the workers will dig through medieval marsh deposits and roman remains jay carver , crossrail lead archaeologist , said : this excavation presents a unique opportunity to understand the lives and deaths of 16 th and 17 th century londoners . pictured : excavations beneath liverpool street an artist 's impression of how the new liverpool street crossrail station will look when it is completed the bedlam burial ground , also known as the new churchyard , was situated near the notorious bethlem royal hospital which opened during london s response to the plague crisis in the 16 th century . the burial site was the first in london which was not associated with a parish church and it did not keep its own burial records . instead , the city s parish churches recorded which of their parishioners were buried at bedlam in their own records . bethlem royal hospital was founded in 1247 and was the first dedicated psychiatric institution in europe the graveyard , built on bethlem hospital s vegetable patch in the 1560 s after churchyards around the city started to overflow , was used to bury london s poor and religious non conformists as well as inmates from the asylum . bethlem royal hospital , which quickly became pronounced bedlam by londoners , was founded in 1247 and was the first dedicated psychiatric institution in europe . it was founded by goffredo de prefetti , who had been elected bishop of bethlehem , and was originally located just outside the london city wall , on the site of what is now liverpool street station . by 1403 , the majority of its patients suffered mental health issues . others suffered from epilepsy , learning disabilities and dementia . bedlam : the scene inside bethlem hospital , as depicted by william hogarth in the rake 's progress due to the hospital 's reputation as the principle treatment centre for the insane , a bastardised version of its name bedlam came to signify madness and chaos more generally . although it is sometimes thought to have treated its patients cruelly , most were free to walk around the grounds . inside the single storey building that housed 12 cells , a kitchen , staff accommodation and an exercise yard , inmates were manacled and chained – and treated as a tourist attraction by londoners who paid a penny to stare at them . patients , usually poor , were given treatments including restraint , dousing with water , beatings and isolation . conditions inside bedlam were depicted by william hogarth in his 18 th century drawings a rake s progress , charting the decline of a merchant s son from wealthy heir to asylum inmate , via debtor s jail . in 1674 , the hospital 's governors decided that the institution should move a few hundred metres to the west to moorfields , with the area 's open space thought to be healthier than its original premises . bethlem moved again in 1815 , to st george 's fields in southwark , which is now the site of the imperial war museum . a final move came in 1930 when the hospital relocated to the suburb of bromley . it is now run by the nhs and is considered to be a leading psychiatric hospital .:==:work underway to excavate remains from burial site disturbed by crossrail . about 3,000 skeletons are now to be excavated from bedlam burial ground . mother and her child buried side by side are among remains to be removed . cemetery

the self proclaimed america s toughest sheriff was struck a humbling blow wednesday when a judge ruled his maricopa county , arizona office will get a court appointed monitor after they lost a racial profiling suit in may . joe arpaio s ultra tough stance on immigration was at the heart of the lawsuit that alleged his office detained latinos for unreasonably long periods . the federal judge also ordered the creation of a community advisory board to ensure the phoenix area sheriff is respecting his latino constituents constitutional rights . while arpaio s enemies have cheered the ruling , the 81 year old responded with characteristic defiance . we are identifying areas that are ripe for appeal , he said . to be clear , the appointed monitor will have no veto authority over my duties or operations . america s toughest sheriff : maricopa county , arizona sheriff joe arpaio will get a court order as part of the fall out from a may ruling that his office engaged in the racial profiling of latinos u.s. district judge murray snow found in may that the maricopa county sheriff 's office and sheriff joe arpaio singled out latinos and deputies unreasonably prolonged detentions . it was the first finding by a court that the agency covering arizona 's most populous county engages in racial profiling after a small group of latinos sued the sheriff 's office for violating their constitutional rights , saying they were being detained simply because of their race . the american civil liberties union , which is working on behalf of the plaintiffs , hailed the ruling as a victory . today 's order is really going to put some sunlight into the corners of the mcso that have been such a problem in terms of people 's civil rights . it is a great day , said aclu lawyer cecillia wang . arpaio s lawyers were less thrilled . arpaio has become nationally known for his unapologetic rejection of obama era immigration policy and self proclaimed status as america 's toughest sheriff can t tell us what to do : arpaio critics won a big prize when the sheriff 's office lost a may racial profiling case . the defiant sheriff her responded to appointment of a court babysitter with characteristic gall wacky : arpaio has a penchant for grabbing headlines . in the wake of the newtown , connecticut school shootings he enlisted action star steven seagal for a program to train children in self defense lawyer tim casey said he was still reviewing the order , but noted he was pleased with its very moderate sensible tone . the sheriff is still in exclusive charge of the mcso , casey said , adding their concern all along was that the monitor would have too much authority . the monitor cannot tell us what to do or not to do , casey said , referring to the monitor 's role in the ruling as overseeing training and procedures , among other things . the court will make the ultimate decision on whether or not the mcso is in compliance with its order , and we are very pleased with that . the judge 's order also mandates that the sheriff 's office install audio and video recording devices in patrol vehicles and requires deputies to notify dispatch of the reason they are making a traffic stop prior to contacting the vehicle 's driver unless exigent circumstances make it u.s.fe or impracticable . arpaio 's attorneys had resisted the latter , telling the judge such an added measure would be burdensome and risky for deputies . i am in the process of discussing it with our attorneys , arpaio said . we are identifying areas that are ripe for appeal . to be clear , the appointed monitor will have no veto authority over my duties or operations . stats do not lie : immigrants who were in the country illegally accounted for 57 percent of the 1,500 people arrested in the 20 crime suppression sweeps conducted by arpaio 's office since january 2008 that is an area that we remain concerned about , casey said wednesday . snow 's ruling does not altogether bar arpaio from enforcing the state 's immigration laws , but it does impose a long list of restrictions on the sheriff 's patrols , some of which focused heavily on latino areas in the county . the ruling prohibited the selection of particular communities , locations or geographic areas for targeted traffic enforcement based to any degree on the racial or ethnic composition of the community . the order also prohibits using race as a factor in deciding whether to stop a vehicle with a latino occupant or detaining latino passengers only on the suspicion that they are in the country illegally . the u.s. justice department filed a similar lawsuit last year that also alleges racial profiling by arpaio 's office . its suit , however , claims broader civil rights violations , such as allegations that arpaio 's agency retaliates against its critics and punishes latino jail inmates with limited english skills for speaking spanish . arpaio has denied the claims .:==:81 year old joe arpaio will have a monitor as his staff are retrained to be better attuned to the constitutional rights of latino residents of arizona 's maricopa county . the phoenix area sheriff 's office was found in may to have violated latinos rights with prolonged detentions . no veto authority over my duties or operations : defiant arpaio says he intends to appeal .
