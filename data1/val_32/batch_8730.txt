the white house threatened wednesday to veto a republican bill to overhaul the widely criticized no child left behind law , calling the effort a significant step backwards . the veto threat came as lawmakers began debate on the measure in the house . a vote is expected on friday . republicans say the bill would restore local control in schools and stop top down education mandates . democrats say it would allow billions in federal dollars to flow out without ensuring they will improve student learning . the white house threatened wednesday to veto a republican bill to overhaul the widely criticized no child left behind law , calling the effort a significant step backwards the bill maintains annual federal testing requirements . it consolidates or eliminates many federal programs , creates a single local grant program and allows public money to follow low income children to different public schools . it would also prohibit the federal education secretary from demanding changes to state standards or imposing conditions on states in exchange for a waiver around federal law . democratic rep . bobby scott of virginia said the bill would allow states to redirect federal funds away from districts with high concentrations of poor students . in other words , the low income areas would get less , the wealthy areas would get more , scott said . if that is the solution , i wonder what you think the problem was . the white house said it was opposed to the bill because it abdicates the historic federal role in elementary and secondary education of ensuring the educational progress of all of america 's students , including students from low income families , students with disabilities , english learners , and students of color . furthermore , the bill fails to identify opportunity gaps or remedy inequities in access to the resources , the white house said . the statement was the latest in a series of veto threats issued by president barack obama since both chambers of congress went under republican control last month . house speaker john boehner of ohio called the education measure a good conservative bill that empowers america and does not empower the bureaucracy here in washington . if you step back and look at what the president s doing , the president s trying to protect the bureaucracy here in washington , he said in a statement . we re for an opportunity society and empowering people around america to do their best and to empower them to get the education that ll help them be successful in life . at a news conference wednesday , boehner called education the civil right of the 21 st century . the measure , pushed by education committee chairman john kline , of minnesota , would provide states and local communities greater flexibility over how federal dollars are used to educate america 's kids , boehner said . kline said education can be the great equalizer in america , but only if schools succeed . about 1 in 5 students drops out of high school , and many who do graduate enter college or the workforce with subpar education , kline said . he decried federal mandates that dictate how to gauge student achievement , define qualified teachers and spend money . we need to place less faith in the secretary of education and more faith in parents , teachers and state and local leaders , he said . speaker of the house john boehner accused the president on wednesday of trying to protect the bureaucracy here in washington . republicans , he said , are for empowering people around america to do their best and to empower them to get the education that ll help them be successful in life the bipartisan no child left behind law president george w bush signed in 2002 sought to close significant gaps in the achievement of historically underserved group of students and their more affluent peers . it mandated annual testing in reading and math for students in grades three to eight and again in high school . schools had to show student growth or face consequences . no child left behind required that all students be able to read and do math at grade level by 2014 . the obama administration in 2012 began allowing waivers around some of the law 's more stringent requirements if schools agreed to certain conditions , like using college and career ready standards such as common core . house republican leaders view the bill as a way to show their opposition to the obama administration 's encouragement of the common core state standards . the standards have been adopted in more than 40 states and spell out what english and math skills students should master at each level . they have become a political issue in many states because they are viewed by critics as a federal effort even though they were developed by u.s. governors . in the senate , there appears to be more of a bipartisan effort to fix the law . republican sen . lamar alexander , the chairman of the senate committee on health , education , labor and pensions , and the committee 's senior democrat , sen . patty murray of washington , have said they were working together on a proposal . alexander said this week he wants to get a bill to the full senate in march .:==:president bush signed the bipartisan no child left behind law in 2002 . republicans say their changes would restore local control in schools and stop top down education mandates coming from washington bureaucrats . the new bill maintains annual federal testing requirements . it would allows public money to follow low income children to different public schools . but according to the white house , it fails to identify opportunity gaps or remedy inequities in access to the resources .

a police officer whose ballistics evidence forms a key element of the murder case against shrien dewani has been exposed as having presented misleading evidence to court . south african forensics officer sgt . pieter engelbrecht was said to have provided shrien dewani 's murder trial with two contradictory explanations of how his wife was shot . the first explanation provided in a statement of fact to court called an affidavit claimed anni was shot with a bullet from a 38 mm calibre , american made revolver type gun , dewani 's trial heard . a police officer whose evidence forms a key element of the murder case against shrien dewani has been exposed as having presented misleading evidence . pictured , shrien dewani , 30 , with murder vicitm anni the officer examined the car in which anni 's body was found with a gunshot wound to the neck the second explanation provided in another affidavit commissioned by sgt . engelbrecht and submitted to the same court claimed anni was shot from a 25 mm calibre , chinese made semi automatic pistol . while shrien dewani 's defence team conceded that anni was shot with the chinese pistol , they argued that sgt . engelbrecht 's apparent willingness to provide contradictory stories indicates bias against their client . as defence barrister pieter botha explained , affidavits are not only meant to be legally binding statements of unambiguous fact , they should also be unique . anni dewani was shot dead on her november 2010 honeymoon to south africa when the taxi cab she and her husband were travelling in was hijacked but aside from the type of gun , both engelbrecht 's affidavits , the barrister claimed in court , are identical , even down to the positioning of the two documents signatures . what is more , the digital metadata contained in an electronic version of one of the documents indicates it was created some 19 months after sgt . engelbrecht claimed it to have been . is it possible , the lawyer botha asked the policeman , that one is a photocopy of the other ? could i put it to you that one crucial aspect was changed in one document and a copy of it was made ? that is what happened here . sgt . engelbrecht said he could not comment on this allegation . the twin affidavits were not the only pieces of questionable evidence sgt . engelbrecht struggled to explain on the witness stand . the officer who said he examined the car in which anni 's body was found was asked about his evidence to the 2012 murder trial of xolile mngeni , the now dead hijacker found guilty of shooting anni dewani . engelbrecht agreed that while he had earlier told a court that mngeni was likely to be anni 's killer , he did not have any conclusive data to support this conclusion . how could you give your opinion when you were unaware of the necessary facts to say so ? dewani 's lawyer asked . maybe i did not understand , engelbrecht replied . you would agree that your answer could have misled the court ? the lawyer went on yes . engelbrecht replied . anni dewani was shot dead on her november 2010 honeymoon to south africa when the taxi cab she and her husband were travelling in was hijacked as it passed through cape town 's dangerous gugulethu township . sgt . pieter engelbrecht was asked about his evidence to the 2012 murder trial of xolile mngeni , the now dead hijacker found guilty of shooting anni dewani . so far three local men including the taxi 's driver have confessed to taking part in the murder plot , but they all claim they did so at shrien dewani 's behest . mziwamadoda qwabe , the only one of these three men present at the moment of anni 's killing claims she was shot by his accomplice xolile mngeni from the cab 's front left passenger seat . giving evidence yesterday , sgt . engelbrecht initially confirmed that , in his opinion , qwabe 's story holds true and that anni was likely to have been shot in the front passenger seat . under cross examination , however , the officer conceded that he based this opinion partly on measurements taken from a different car to the one used in the hijack and one in which the seats were positioned differently to the way they were during the hijack . shrien dewani denies any involvement in the murder of his wife . the case will not sit tomorrow in order that both anni and shrien dewanis families can celebrate the hindu festival of diwali what on earth did you , an expert , hope to achieve when you took measurements of a vehicle where the distances are nothing to do with the car in this case ? , dewani 's apparently incredulous barrister asked the policeman , to an ambiguous response . later , when sgt . engelbrecht refused to acknowledge that one of his own photographs taken on tuesday this week and submitted as evidence later the same day proved him to have taken inaccurate measurements , the lawyer botha went further . you are miles away from being an objective witness , botha chided the policeman . you do not want to concede that which an objective person even a child can see to be true . it is patently clear that your previous evidence is false , to which sgt . engelbrecht replied : it is not a matter that i wanted to mess up the case . shrien dewani denies any involvement in the murder of his wife . the case will not sit tomorrow in order that both anni and shrien dewanis families can celebrate the hindu festival of diwali . it is set to resume next monday .:==:sgt . pieter engelbrecht was said to have provided shrien dewani 's murder trial with two contradictory explanations of how his wife was shot . the forensics officers explanations detailed different murder weapons . anni dewani was shot dead on her november 2010 honeymoon to south africa when the taxi cab she and her husband were travelling in was hijacked . shrien is on trial for her murder but insists that he was not involved .

once regarded as harbingers of doom , fiery meteors are believed to strike the earth at complete random . but a new study into impact trends suggests meteor strikes are more likely to occur at certain times of the year and at certain locations . the spanish study found that the frequency of impacts was higher when earth 's orbit took it through streams of meteoroids created by the break up of a comet . the chelyabinsk meteor was caused by a near earth asteroid that entered earth 's atmosphere over russia on 15 february 2013 . scientists now believe events such as this are not as random as once thought most of the meteors analysed as part of the research also hit the earth in the second half of the year , according to the university of madrid . this lack of randomness is induced by planetary perturbations , in particular jupiter 's , and suggests that some of the recent , most powerful earth impacts may be associated with resonant groups of near earth objects and or very young meteoroid streams , the study claims . planets and moon can affect meteors , pushing them into orbits called aresonant streams . researchers looked at 33 multi kiloton impact events from 2000 to 2013 that were detected by infrasound acoustic pressure sensors . most of the meteors analysed as part of the research hit the earth in the second half of the year , according to the university of madrid . pictured is the part of the large meteor that hit russia in 2013 in the southern hemisphere , june is the most likely month for a meteor to hit the earth , while september and october were the least likely . north of the equator , november is the most likely month for a meteor hit , while may and june were the least likely . the study found that 17 impacts took place in the northern hemisphere and 16 in the south . the sensors are designed to detect secret nuclear tests , but also pick up meteor impacts with when they have an explosive energy in excess of a thousand tonnes of tnt . they found 17 impacts took place in the northern hemisphere and 16 in the south . of these impact , 25 took place within 40 degrees north or south of the equator , while eight took place at higher latitudes . twenty impacts across the second half of the year were recorded compared to just 13 hits in the first six calendar months – a 21 per cent difference in timing . in the southern hemisphere , june was the most likely month for a meteor to hit the earth , while september and october were the least likely . in the southern hemisphere , june was the most likely month for a meteor to hit the earth artist 's impression pictured , while september and october were the least likely overall , 12 meteor impacts took place in the second half of the year compared to four in the first six months . north of the equator , november was the most likely month for a meteor hit while may and june were the least likely . nine meteors hit earth in the first half of the year and eight in the second half . what we had always assumed up until this paper , was that meteor impacts were random , occurring at any time and in any place , dr simon o toole of the australian astronomical observatory told abc science . but more data is needed . it s a very interesting paper , but 33 events is a statistically small sample range , said dr o toole . collision course : map shows the number of asteroids striking earth 's atmosphere over a 20 year period a flash of light from a fiery asteroid is often treated with intrigue when it is spotted on earth . but scientists at nasa suggest that asteroids are smashing into the earth 's atmosphere at a higher rate than most people realise . according to a new map by the space agency , it is a wonder we do not see fireballs raining down from the skies more frequently . the map from the space agency 's near earth object program , reveals that more than 556 space rocks smashed into the atmosphere over a 20 year period between 1994 and 2013 . the orange dots on the diagram show the frequency of asteroids that hit locations during the day while the blue dots show those that hit at night . they are measured in billions of joules of energy . most space rocks were small and harmless and disintegrated when they hit the atmosphere . yet there are exceptions . last year on february 15 , an asteroid which was 55 feet in diameter with a mass of up to 10,000 tons crashed to earth in the urals region in russia .:==:study looked at 33 major meteor impact events between 2000 to 2013 . frequency was higher when earth 's orbit took it through meteoroids . slightly more meteors tend to hit the earth in the second half of year . 17 impacts took place in the northern hemisphere and 16 in the south . 25 impact events took place within 40 degrees north or south of equator . in southern hemisphere , june is most likely month for a meteor to hit . november is most likely month for meteors to hit northern hemisphere .

this was the finest drive of lewis hamilton s career in the greatest grand prix of the century . it was a privilege to be in bahrain , where hamilton and his fellow mercedes driver nico rosberg duelled and duelled again , only inches from perdition at up to 200 mph . the action behind them was hardly less compelling . the race rather made those who had criticised this year s brand of formula one as boring — not least bernie ecclestone and ferrari president luca di montezemolo — look as if they were speaking out of their exhaust pipes . video scroll down to watch rosberg : fair play to lewis but i will be back in two weeks to win triumphant : lewis hamilton holds his trophy aloft after victory at the bahrain grand prix merc magic : hamilton and mercedes team mate nico rosberg embrace after their one two finish in bahrain victorious : hamilton takes the chequered flag after keeping a dogged rosberg at bay domination : hamilton held off rosberg , who started on pole , to win the bahrain grand prix click here to relive this pulsating race lap for lap with sportsmail 's phil duncan and jonathan mcevoy . the victor was hamilton , taking his second successive win and his 24 th in all to equal juan manuel fangio s career total . it was a race that all the laws of logic decreed he should never have won . he started second on the grid to rosberg , having made a slip in qualifying , but stayed tight around the first corner to take the lead and then held off rosberg s counter attack on the fourth turn . rosberg did not give up at the start of the 18 th and 19 th laps he tried to wriggle past hamilton . the lead changed hands , by my estimation , five times . rosberg said on the team radio : what he did wasn t on it was heat of the moment exasperation rather than a serious complaint . take off : the mercedes of nico rosberg and lewis hamilton lead the field at the start of the race bunch : the field shapes up for turn 1 of the bahrain international circuit in sakhir and hamilton takes the lead head to head : the fierce battle between rosberg and hamilton began at the outset of the race fortune favoured rosberg when a spectacular shunt brought out the safety car . esteban gutierrez s sauber went into a 360 degree somersault when he was flipped by pastor maldonado s lotus . the two mercedes immediately came in to be reshod . hamilton had to change to the harder tyre , rosberg could use the softer . the softer rubber is faster so , once the safety car peeled away with 10 laps remaining , rosberg would be able to pass his team mate from a gap that had been reduced to virtually nothing by the break in racing . so the theory went . i remember our first race in karting , said hamilton afterwards . nico was leading all the way and i overtook him on the last lap . i thought that would happen to me today . so did we all . but , no , hamilton produced his best ever defensive driving in repelling the relentless attack from behind . they were crawling over each other like spiders . rosberg would get in front but hamilton — in a now you see me now you don t flash — squirmed back ahead . neck and neck : hamilton leads rosberg as they challenge each other wheel to wheel watching the front : the mercedes team watch their cars dominate the bahrain race burn rubber : ferrari 's kimi raikkonen breaks heavily ahead of red bull 's daniel ricciardo credit here to mercedes . paddy lowe , in the first serious test of his pit wall nerve since taking over as technical director , came on to both men . he said : this is paddy . that made it clear it was the headmaster speaking and defiance would not be tolerated . with 10 laps to race , he added , let s just make sure we bring both cars home . it was not an instruction to hold position , but an appeal for sense . credit , too , to both hamilton and rosberg for possessing the serenity and skill to follow the appeal meticulously . the best drive of hamilton s career , we have asserted . a case can be made for silverstone in 2008 , when he dominated the wet conditions , senna like , to win by more than a minute . dig in the ribs : hamilton and rosberg exchange playful blows after the race come here , you : fresh from battling on the track the pair went toe to toe in parc ferme , too but this was purer . here , he was fighting a driver at the peak of his career in an equal car on better tyres in a crucial battle in a formative world championship rivalry . so intense was the racing that rosberg got out of his car and rugby tackled hamilton through sheer adrenaline . moments afterwards , his thoughts calmer , the german admitted : i strongly dislike losing to lewis . so was this the best of grand prix of the century ? hamilton s title win in 2008 had a single epic moment of drama . jenson button s triumph in canada in 2011 was wet , mad and protracted . mika hakkinen s victory over michael schumacher at spa in 2000 produced an overtaking move for the ages . but has any race contained more wheel to wheel action throughout the field ? not that i can recall . force india fought force india , with sergio perez finally winning through to take third after a joust with nico hulkenberg . red bull fought red bull , with daniel ricciardo passing world champion sebastian vettel for fourth . flipped : sauber 's esteban gutierrez crashes after being bumped by lotus driver pastor maldonado t boned : pastor maldonado rams into estaban gutierrez on his way out of the pits leading to a spectacular flip over and out : gutierrez 's sauber spins out of control before getting airborne lucky escape : gutierrez goes over before his car comes to a stop of the track leading to a safety car podium : sahara force india 's sergio perez celebrates his third place team game : mercedes celebrated their second 1 to 2 finish in as many races they lead the constructors championship pure theatre : rosberg and hamilton duel for the lead of the bahrain grand prix time to celebrate : hamilton with his winners trophy williams fought williams , with felipe massa and valtteri bottas going at each other hard . all this was showcased breathtakingly under a necklace of lights in the desert . the special bulbs made the car liveries vivid and high definition sharp . even the build up to the race was febrile . team principals walked in and out of the adjoining offices of ecclestone and jean todt , the fia president . ferrari chief di montezemolo told a phalanx of tv cameras that the drivers were being reduced to taxi drivers because the new regulations placed an emphasis on such boring matters as fuel consumption . ecclestone was in the same camp , as are red bull . not so todt . although he confirmed that the sport is looking at ways to amplify the engine noise in the next few weeks , he favours the new , greener formula . as does the mclaren chairman ron dennis , who rounded on vettel s recent remark that the new turbos sounded s . dennis , both of whose cars retired with clutch problems , said : being a world champion requires a dignified approach . putting aside the language for the moment , the sentiment is inappropriate . from rows to racing , it was the formula one day that had everything under the stars . champagne moment : rosberg covers his team mate in the fizzy stuff as they celebrate what drama : the bahrain grand prix was one of the finest formula one races in recent times .:==:lewis hamilton wins in bahrain after fantastic duel with nico rosberg . sergio perez completes the podium with force india . jenson button retires on his 250 th appearance in formula one . action throughout the pack with three times world champion niki lauda lauding it as one of the best races he has ever seen . rosberg admits on the podium he strongly dislikes finishing second to hamilton .

the obama administration has taken another step in its effort to combat rape on college campuses with the release of a new report . the white house task force to protect students from sexual assault produced the 20 page report . the task force , including attorney general eric holder and secretary of education arne duncan , spent the last three months talking to thousands of people and compiled a number of very specific recommendations : more data : the task force wants to know more about the scope and scale of the problem . the report cites a statistic from the national institute of justice that one in five women experience rape or attempted rape in college but say the group needs to know more . this year , the task force is pushing schools to use its tool kit in 2015 to survey their campuses . by 2016 , the task force will be reporting . the report said we will explore legislative or administrative options to require the schools to conduct a survey . survivors need more : in 2011 , the administration first alerted schools about their responsibilities to survivors of sexual violence . the administration said that under title ix schools had to address sexual violence in order to provide equal access to education . but schools have struggled with that . in the past three years many have been publicly cited for failing to live up to these standards . most recently , the department of education announced that tufts university failed to comply with title ix in the way it handles sexual assaults . the school wrote it was surprised and disappointed with the finding , adding it was deeply committed to the safety and well being of our students . so now the administration is getting more specific . the importance of having confidential advocates is now emphasized . this point clarifies what had been confusing for many , namely that not everyone on college campuses has a duty to report . in recent years , some schools have directed nearly all their employees . to report all the details of an incident to school officials , the report said , which can mean a survivor quickly loses control over what happens next . that is a critical issue for many advocates who emphasize the importance of returning control to survivors . the administration calls for further training for those who deal with sexual violence on college campuses . insensitive or judgmental comments or questions that focus on a victim 's behavior e g , what she was wearing , her prior sexual history rather than on the alleged perpetrator 's can compound a victim 's distress , the report notes . on the enforcement side , the report calls for new models for investigating and adjudicating cases on campus and for a pilot program aimed at rehabilitating offenders . tuesday , the white house unveiled a new public service announcement encouraging men to help women who are in danger of being sexually assaulted . the psa features several hollywood stars , including steve carell and seth meyers and will air in movie theaters beginning in may . transparency : one of the biggest problems with sexual violence on college campuses is that no college wants to admit it has a problem . parents do not want to send their children to a school where data shows more sexual crimes occur , that could ding rankings and potentially because problems with donors . paradoxically , advocates say , those schools that have high numbers may actually be taking the problem seriously . that is because they have robust systems in place that allow for students to file complaints . now the government wants to centralize all that data on notalone . gov . accountability : it will not just be numbers on notalone . gov . the administration will also put forms online making it easier for students to complain if their school fails to live up to the other obligations . many of the department of justice and department of education investigations over the years have resulted from student complaints . so what does this all mean ? according to know your ix , an organization that seeks to educate college students about title ix rights , it is a good step , but more is needed . these changes will mean little until title ix enforcement is finally given teeth , the organization said . know your ix said the administration is reluctant to use the best leverage it currently has , namely pulling a school 's federal funding . the agency has never once sanctioned a school for sexual violence related violations of title ix , the organization said . students accuse columbia of mishandling sexual assault complaints student activists fight to end rape on campus teens trained to spot drama before it turns dangerous .:==:white house task force releases new report related to combating rape on college campuses . task force wants to gather more data to learn scope , scale of problem . helping campus rape victims framed as an equal education access issue by administration . title ix advocacy group : it is a good first step , but more action is needed .

european union foreign ministers on monday imposed new sanctions on the syrian regime , urging it to adopt a you . n backed peace plan that so far has failed to stop the mounting carnage . at the same time , effects of the syrian conflict are being felt in neighboring lebanon , where clashes have killed at least seven people near tripoli . the eu ministers froze the assets of two firms and imposed a travel ban and asset freeze on three people believed to provide funding for the regime , the european council announced . it is the 15 th time the european union has imposed restrictions on syria since a popular uprising began there early last year . the continuing violence is appalling , eu foreign policy chief catherine ashton said monday , adding that the sanctions are aimed at the regime and not the civilian population . as long as the repression continues , we will continue to put pressure on those responsible for it , she said in brussels . inside syria on monday , regime forces suffered heavy casualties during clashes in rastan , a city that has been pummeled by government forces , opposition activists said . the syrian observatory for human rights said it received preliminary information that three armored personnel carriers were destroyed and that at least 23 soldiers were killed . elsewhere in syria , at least four people were killed monday , said the local coordination committees of syria , an opposition network . the dead included a child struck by random gunfire from the regime 's army in deir ezzor , the lcc said . the group also posted reports of the military aiming mortars and heavy artillery at the homs village of al burnhanieh . the syrian government on monday reported four deaths , including a colonel and lieutenant colonel killed by armed terrorist groups in damascus and daraa , according to the state run syrian arab news agency . cnn cannot independently verify reports of deaths and violence because the syrian government has severely restricted access by international media . the syrian conflict is playing a role in clashes that broke out sunday in neighboring lebanon , where it has ignited historic divisions among residents of two tripoli suburbs . the fighting in lebanon pits residents of bab al tebbaneh , a sunni stronghold hostile to the syrian regime , against alawite residents of jabal mohsen , who support syrian president and fellow alawite bashar al assad . at least seven people have been killed and 45 others hurt in the two days of fighting , lebanon 's national news agency reported monday . islamists in northern lebanon , specifically tripoli , have opposed the syrian regime for decades . but as syria strengthened its control over lebanon in the 1990 s , it also strengthened elements of the alawite community , a shiite offshoot , in the north . the fighting in the tripoli suburbs is part of the legacy of syrian intervention in northern lebanon , according to nadim shehadi , associate fellow of the middle east and north africa program at the london think tank chatham house . it was the arrest of islamist activist chadi mawlawi that sparked the current fighting . one of his cousins says mawlawi was supporting the syrian rebels and trying to help syrian refugees by providing shelter and food . though the lebanese government accuses mawlawi of being an operative in an al qaeda inspired group something his relatives deny it may have been mawlawi 's help to the refugees that got him in trouble . helping syrian refugees puts the lebanese government in a difficult position as it tries to stay out of the syrian conflict , shehadi told cnn . the lebanese government 's aim is to maintain neutrality and avoid spillover from syria to lebanon , but that is an impossible objective to attain because if you help the refugees , you are supporting the revolution , and if you do not help the revolution , you are supporting the regime . so in both cases , neutrality is impossible to maintain , shehadi said . a team of you . n monitors is in syria to see how well both sides are implementing a six point peace plan brokered by former you . n secretary general kofi annan . annan said last week that the observers are the last hope for success of the plan , which involves a cease fire by all parties and the withdrawal of syrian forces from populated areas . since the cease fire went into effect on april 12 , the fighting and killing have continued , with the lcc reporting more than 1,000 deaths in the intervening weeks . the united nations estimates that at least 9,000 people have died in the 14 month crisis , while opposition groups put the death toll at more than 11,000 . despite the ongoing chaos , syrian state run media announced that results from recent parliamentary elections will be announced tuesday . more than 7,000 candidates vied for 250 parliamentary seats . but members of the opposition had urged syrians to boycott the elections , saying a vote for any of the candidates amounted to a vote for al assad , whose family has ruled the country for 42 years . cnn 's saad abedine , laura perez maestro and holly yan contributed to this report .:==:opposition :

a new jersey amusement park that was as famous for the many lawsuits brought against it as it was for its rides , with no fewer than six people losing their lives there and 110 people reported injuries in a single year . since it closed in 1996 , action park became the stuff of urban legend and nostalgia , even inspiring a documentary called the most insane amusement park ever . and as of june 14 , action park is back , complete with a new attraction , the zero g , which drops riders through a trapdoor and down a 100 foot high slide , which action park 's owners says is the tallest of its kind . notorious : the most insane amusement park ever , action park is back in , well , action nostalgia : children of the 1980 s and 90 s remember action park with equal parts fondness and fear at action park , it felt like you were in some crazy guy s backyard , dave schlussman , a 30 year old from greenpoint , told the new york post . the rides defied any kind of procedure . the rural resort drew thousands of revelers everyday from 1978 until 1996 in spite of or maybe because of its freewheeling reputation for danger . we d race some u.s.specting guy on the alpine slide , said dana bornstein , 44 , who worked at the park as a teenager in the 1980 s . we d be at the bottom and see the cart come down by itself . next thing you know , they would be bringing the guy to first aid . bornstein was one of roughly 100 former employees who gathered for a reunion at the legendary water park on saturday to celebrate its rechristening . action park closed in 1996 and reopened two years later as mountain creek . owners decided to switch back to the original name in an attempt to capitalize on the nostalgia some might say notoriety of its earlier heyday . safety first : the newly opened action park adheres to the new jersey department of community affairs regulations write caption here one of the first waterparks in the country , action park opened in 1978 , sometimes introducing new attractions almost as soon they were invented . pretty much any backyard inventor with a crazy idea knew this was the place to try it out , said bill benneyan , president of mountain creek resort , which owns action park . one such ride was only in action for a month before it was shut down . the cannonball loop was a water slide with a 360 degree loop at the end . a man who claims his father built the slide told buzzfeed that stories about dismembered crash test dummies are completely true . the story about the dummies is completely true they used the dummies to test several of the rides at the park and every time a dummy came off the ride dismembered they would try it again until it stayed in one piece , then they would pay someone to test it he said . video source fox new york the cannonball loop : the slide with it is 360 degree loop was short lived , in action only a month before it caused too many injuries and was shut down fun for the whole family : despite its safety track record , action park is remembered with fondness by many children of the 80 s and 90 s matt weismantel , who worked at the park from 1979 to 1984 recounted watching operators turn on the wave pool also known as the grave pool , at the time one of the first in the country , for the first time . he heard a scream and saw a woman clinging to the side of the wall , her feet above the water . she did not realize that when the wave went through , there would be nothing underneath her , weismantel said . the park earned a reputation for danger and six people died there from 1980 to 1987 . news accounts from the new jersey herald in the 1980 s reported hundreds of lawsuits in little more than a few years . the alpine slide was the site of 26 head injuries and 14 fractures in a two year period . executives at the newly renamed action park hope they can resurrect that reputation for risk without the actual danger . the alpine slide and a seldom used waterslide known as the cannonball loop have been removed . reporter anna gilligan recently took the plunge on the high anxiety ride and lived to tell the tale in a tour of the park on saturday , benneyan stressed that the state inspects rides at the beginning and end of the season , plus conducts periodic checks during the season . some of the former employees expressed a sense of nostalgia for a time when kids and teenagers roamed free and a little bit of danger was associated with growing up when you are the first to do something , you do it without regulation , said amy rude , 39 , who worked at the park from 1990 to 1995 . action park is from a moment in time that can never happen again . former park employee mike donahan , 40 , remembers seeing wipeouts on the alpine slide that left kids with scrapes severe enough to require a trip to the first aid office but not immobilizing enough to keep them from soon returning to the same ride . they d be bleeding and jump right into the pools , he said . i do not even know how much chlorine they put in the pool .:==:action park re opened on june 15 . it was closed in 1996 amid personal injury lawsuits after six people died and countless were injured there . a documentary was made about it called the most insane amusement park ever . the park includes some old favorites as well as brand new rides .

the tokyo game show this year has two big stars , sony 's playstation 4 and the microsoft xbox one . but with huge numbers of young , barely dressed models also in attendance , game fans may well find their gaze drawn elsewhere . asia 's largest video game expo kicked off today at makuhari messe convention center in chiba , east of tokyo , with a record number of games developers taking part . and judging by these pictures , they have brought with them record numbers of scantily clad young women , leading to scenes reminiscent of a seventies era car show . who cares about video games ? models pose for photos as they promote smartphone games at the tokyo game show in chiba , suburban tokyo like a seventies car show . the game show kicked off with a record high number of exhibitors consisting of 352 companies and organisations from 33 different countries many of the models are dressed as characters from the games complete with colourful wigs , skimpy outfits and oversized , futuristic weaponry . others were provocatively styled as cro top wearing , cleavage baring schoolgirls , complete with the knee socks and tartan skirts more typically associated with japanese school uniforms . the contrast with the show is visitors mostly conservatively dressed men offers an apt reminder of why the computer entertainment industry is under attack for its representation of women . but such debates were quite clearly off the cards at today 's event , where most attention was directed at the eagerly awaited new offerings from sony and microsoft . in a reversal of the old order , both the playstation 4 and the xbox one are to go on sale first in the u.s. and europe in november , far ahead of expected japanese release dates slated for next year . sony and microsoft both say tailoring the machines for the japanese market takes more time but many in the gaming world see the delay as symbolic of japan 's loss of its pioneering and leading role in the industry . fancy dress

him dressed in a leather playsuit with eyes on a comeback , this year 's show has a renewed focus this year on independent game software developers . game insiders and experts say that encouraging a new breed of game creators is crucial for japan to regain its status in the game world , ceded over the years to the u.s. and europe where startups face fewer obstacles . it is felt that the broader stagnation witnessed in the japanese economy also infected the game world , where big success was followed by complacency , and even a stifling of newcomers . a presentation by sony executives today signalled this fresh attempt to woo independent developers . flashed on a giant screen was the slogan made up of the words ps , which stands for playstation , and indies , with a big red heart mark in the middle . we are welcoming the contributions of independent developers , said masayasu ito , senior vice president at sony computer entertainment , the tokyo based electronics and entertainment

inafune believes japan must first recognise its failure before it can move on , as most have become too comfortable and set in their ways , resting on the laurels of past success . still worse , they have grown cautious , and churn out sequels of the old formulas , instead of taking risks , he said . suddenly , japanese games were not selling , and they did not look as good as they used to look , compared to foreign games , he told the associated press . we need to first confront our own defeat , and we need to start learning from the world . previously a star creative at capcom , where over a sparkling three decade career he was behind such hits as mega man and dead rising , mr inafune started his own game company comcept three years ago . he says he is determined to show japan is ready to reinvent itself . japan is going to rise again to the top , he said at his comcept office in tokyo . we have to go back to our roots and rediscover what made japan great . visitors play a wargaming .

announced . phil spencer , corporate vice president at microsoft game studios , says tailoring xbox one for the japanese market is taking more time , such as making sure the voice recognition feature works and signing on partnerships for local content . but he denied the importance of japan was diminishing for microsoft , and stressed more software titles were in the works for xbox one , including d4 from star developer hidetaka suehiro . instead , he said the changes were more about a growing diversity in types of games because they were being played on smartphones and tablets , as well as consoles . the creative capability here is without match , said mr spencer .:==:asia 's largest video game show kicked off in japan today . it has a record number of exhibitors who seem to have brought a record number of models along with them . but it comes as the japanese industry is in crisis and losing ground to western developers .
