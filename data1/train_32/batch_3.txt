a group of male carpenters , plumbers and cleaners have won a landmark equal pay case after complaining they were paid less than female secretaries . the 18 workmen sued saying they were given around £4,000 less a year than women on the same pay scale when their employer merged with another university last year . now in what is thought to be the first decision involving such a large group of men , bosses have agreed and the workers along with eight others are in line for £30,000 each in back pay . landmark case : workmen nicholas thomas , rob cooze and mike betson are among 26 due £30,000 each from the university of wales trinity st david after saying they were paid less than female colleagues the university of wales , trinity st david which merged with the men 's former employer swansea metropolitan university had insisted the difference was not due to gender . but in a surprise you turn , the university said today it would no longer contest the case . a spokesman said chiefs had re thought their position after a former swansea vice chancellor , professor david warner , gave evidence to their employment tribunal . we came to the view the original claim presented by staff to the former swansea metropolitan university had due merit and , as a result , an appropriate remedy should be agreed and actioned , the spokesman added . but the spokesman insisted the situation was not the university 's fault and was down to historical decisions by swansea before the metropolitan university ceased to exist . changing hands : the men were all employed at swansea metropolitan university which has since become a campus of university of wales trinity st david . the university blamed historical decisions it is believed to be the first time that such a large group of men have launched legal action in britain claiming sexual discrimination . although tribunals brought by men are not unheard of , the case involving the welsh university workers has been described as very unusual . all the men were originally employed by swansea metropolitan university which merged with the university of wales trinity saint david in august last year . they were on grade three of the university 's pay scale and the dispute arose when their contracts changed . previously , the men had been on a minimum 45 hour week until new regulations sought to standardise all workers to a 37 hour week instead . fearing the drop in hours would because problems , university bosses said they would guarantee the men the extra eight hours but class it as overtime pay . victory : tradesman rob cooze , 50 , plumber mike betson , 65 , and carpenter nicholas thomas , 47 , address the media outside the employment tribunal in cardiff where the group may have won £750,000 yet when the new system was put in place , the men said they realised their hourly rate was less than women including secretaries and office employees who were on the same pay grade . both parties are yet to agree a payout but it is thought it will amount to £30,000 in back pay for each of the 18 workers , along with eight more who said they would lodge the same claim . women may have first earned the vote in 1918 , but it would take more than 50 years before they were given the right to demand the same wages as men . the equal pay act was only passed in 1970 and did not become law until 1976 , finally giving women the right to the same salaries and terms as men doing the same job . yet many employers , who had lobbied against the act saying it would bankrupt them , simply re graded women 's jobs so that on paper they were technically serving a different role to men . the equality act 2010 tightened up many of the laws enacted in 1970 and people can sue if they are doing broadly the same job , even if it is not given the same title . yet many women still feel they have a raw deal . the pay gap widened for the first time in five years in december with women earning an average of £5,000 a year less often because men still take many of the top jobs . the workers lawyers will also apply for costs , though the men are not seeking money for injury to feelings . speaking outside the employment tribunal in cardiff , robert cooze , 50 , from swansea , said he and his colleagues were over the moon . we did not want it to come to this really but we are glad common sense has prevailed , said mr cooze . it s been admitted that we have been discriminated against . with all due respect to our new employers , trinity st david , this is completely new to them and is a historical issue . i would like to think that they have had some input into this . we are just so relieved and can get on with our ordinary working days now . at certain times it did get us down because in the past . we felt like we were not being listened to i just hope it has not soured any relations between us and our new employers . the trinity st david spokesman added : the employment tribunal related to events that occurred more than seven years ago at the now dissolved higher education corporation swansea metropolitan university , and several years before its merger with the university of wales trinity saint david which took place in 2013 . the university of wales trinity saint david had no involvement in the decisions that were made by swansea metropolitan university in 2007 . this was a complex case and we are very disappointed the new university now has to deal with , in an appropriate manner and with due care , the consequences of historical decisions . rob cooze said : we are just so relieved and can get on with our ordinary working days now .:==:26 workers in swansea could receive around £750,000 in back pay . it is thought to be first sex discrimination case by a large group of men . they lost out when swansea metropolitan university changed hands . when they moved to new contracts with university of wales , hourly rate was less than for women already employed on the same pay scale . university bosses have now withdrawn case and are discussing a payout . robert cooze , 50 , said : we re glad common sense has prevailed .

world bank president robert zoellick will step down in june world bank president robert zoellick will step down in june it has been revealed and the u.s. government has indicated that his replacement could go to a non american . the obama administration said it would open the process to competition , marking the first time it has shown willingness to loosen its grip on the world 's top development lender . zoellick took the reins at the bank in 2007 after a staff revolt pushed out paul wolfowitz , and he moved quickly to return the institution 's focus to alleviating poverty . developing countries have for years pressed for a greater voice in leading global financial institutions and are likely to stress the importance of a competitive process , but the united states is still widely expected to retain its hold on the job . u.s. treasury secretary timothy geithner said in a statement : it is very important that we continue to have strong , effective leadership of this important institution , and in the coming weeks , we plan to put forward a candidate with experience and requisite qualities to take this institution forward . while geithner called for an open and expeditious process , analysts say washington can ill afford to give up the post without risking the u.s. congress cutting funding for the bank . in an interview , zoellick said his decision to leave on june 30 at the end of his five year term was his own and was not due to pressure from the obama administration . the former u.s. chief trade negotiator and deputy secretary of state dismissed speculation he would join a republican presidential campaign as not true , saying only that he would decide what to do next once he leaves the world bank . it really was my own decision , zoellick said . my personal sense is it is time to move on and i think once you feel that way you should not stay . zoellick , who discussed the selection process with the board in a two hour meeting yesterday , said the first step was for the board to call for nominations . an open process is important , he said . in the running ? possible u.s. candidates include secretary of state hillary clinton , left , and former white house economic adviser lawrence summers , right speculation has been rife over who might take the job when zoellick departs . possible u.s. candidates include secretary of state hillary clinton and former white house economic adviser lawrence summers , but the state department said clinton would not be taking the job . she has said this is not happening , spokeswoman victoria nuland said . emerging market and developing countries have campaigned hard in recent years to break europe 's grip on the top position at the international monetary fund and the united states hold on the presidency of the world bank . officials from large emerging economies like brazil said the selection process for zoellick 's successor should be based on qualifications and not nationality . however , they acknowledged that given u.s. congressional pressure the job will probably remain in the hands of an american . last year , emerging market economies made an aggressive push to fill the imf top job in a bitter contest won by france 's christine lagarde . on capitol hill , lawmakers said the world bank job should stay in u.s. hands . zoellick took the reins at the bank hq in washington pictured in 2007 after a staff revolt pushed out paul wolfowitz i think it ought to be an american given the balance between that and the imf and the interests that we have right now , said senate foreign relations committee chairman john kerry , a democrat from massachusetts . senator richard lugar of indiana , the committee 's top republican , echoed that sentiment : ideally i would like to see an american replace him . that would be my preference . nancy birdsall , who heads the center for global development in washington , said that while the united states was committed to an open process on paper , domestic politics necessitated a american successor . the election year timing puts the white house in an especially unenviable position . there is a risk that the world bank could become a highly partisan , u.s. hot button issue , as the un has too often been , she wrote in a recent blog . when zoellick took the job in july 2007 , he turned the attention of the bank to a brewing food and energy price crisis that was stoking social unrest in the poorest parts of the world . as the bank looked for ways to help , the global financial crisis of 2008 threatened to undermine more than a decade of strong growth in emerging and developing countries . under zoellick , world bank lending increased sharply to $44 billion in fiscal 2010 from $13.5 billion in 2008 , reflecting the increased development needs of fast rising countries in asia , africa , latin america and the middle east . zoellick also won approval for an $86.2 billion increase in the bank 's general resources . it was the first increase in more than 20 years . he championed more voting power for emerging economies and convinced china , brazil and others to contribute more funding . despite budget strains in the developed world , zoellick lobbied for and secured more than $90 billion in pledges to replenish a separate world bank fund for the poorest countries . in an effort to modernize the world bank , he has given a greater voice to emerging economies . he has also championed the need for better governance in regions such as the middle east , where street protests toppled dictators in tunisia , egypt and libya .:==:robert zoellick will step down in june after five years .u.s. still expected to retain its hold on the top job .

the queen will today grant a posthumous pardon for wartime codebreaker alan turing , who was convicted in the 1950 s for homosexual activity . the pardon is only the fourth since the second world war to be granted under the royal prerogative of mercy . it was requested by justice secretary chris grayling , who described turing as a national hero who fell foul of the law because of his sexuality . pardoned : almost 60 years after he killed himself with cyanide , gay enigma codebreaker alan turing will be given a royal pardon for the conviction which destroyed his life . homosexual acts were only legalised in 1967 mathematical genius : mr turing was seen as the father of modern computing and artifical intelligence a life destroyed : alan turing with friends in his youth . he was 41 when he poisoned himself with cyanide ordinary house , extraordinary deeds : hut 8 naval inteligence , where alan turing worked to crack german codes at bletchley park , milton keynes . there has been a long running campaign to clear his name codebreaker : the machine designed by alan turing which cracked the german enigma code , thereby stripping the german you boats which were blockading britain of their cover during the second world war icon : the codebreaker was previously honoured with a statue in manchester 's gay village , left , and a cover of the gay magazine attitude , right . gay rights activist peter tatchell said all those convicted should be pardoned during the second world war , the mathematician was pivotal in cracking the german enigma codes , which gave allied leaders vital information about the movement and intentions of hitler s forces . historians credit the work of turing and his fellow codebreakers at bletchley park in buckinghamshire with shortening the war by up to two years , saving countless lives . turing is also widely seen as the father of computer science and artificial intelligence . but in 1952 he was convicted for homosexual activity , which was illegal at the time . to avoid prison , turing agreed to chemical castration  hormonal treatment designed to reduce libido . in 1954 , aged 41 , he died of cyanide poisoning . an inquest recorded a verdict of suicide , although his mother and others maintained that his death was accidental . as well as physical and emotional damage , his conviction had led to the removal of his security clearance and meant he was no longer able to work for gchq , the successor to the government code and cypher school , based at bletchley park . speaking today , baroness trumpington who worked with turing at bletchley park praised her former colleague , saying we could have lost the war had it not been for his work . she told bbc radio 4 's today programme : i really am very pleased . we knew the work he was doing at bletchley park was great . without him , we could have lost the war . our submarines were being sunk at the rate of knots . we could have lost the war through starvation . that is how bad it was . legendary : mr turing 's story was dramatised several times , including in the 1986 play breaking the code , which played at london 's theatre royal . alan turing , right , was played by sir derek jacobi drama : turing will be played by benedict cumberbatch in the forthcoming drama the imitation game , which also features kiera knightley . the pair were spotted filming in london 's king 's cross station in october more recently turing was depicted by ed stoppard in the channel 4 drama britain 's greatest codebreaker rare : there have only been three royal pardons since the end of the second world war turing is being granted a pardon after a long campaign to rehabilitate his reputation . pardons are usually given when someone has been found to be innocent after the event , but government sources said turing was being pardoned because he was a truly exceptional man who saved britain . that means the decision to pardon turing will not lead to pardons for the other 50,000 men convicted of similar homosexual offences . mr grayling told the mail : in a list of britain s war heroes , the names of people like churchill , montgomery , barnes wallis , stand proud . alan turing s name should sit with them . and yet after the war , far from being feted as a hero , he finished his life in disgrace . he was hauled before the courts and humiliated . his crime was that he was gay . i have always regarded it as one of the great blights on our country s history that a man who did so much for all of us should have been treated in such a terrible way . and i am proud that the queen has agreed to my request that he should be granted a full posthumous pardon , and that his memory should now have no stain upon it alan turing is one of the key reasons why britain remained a free country . it is right that we should remember and celebrate his memory free from the taint of injustice . the campaign to pardon turing was backed by mps from all parties and by scientists such as the physicist stephen hawking . an e petition calling for a pardon received 37,404 signatures . in 2009 the then prime minister gordon brown issued a public apology for his treatment but did not secure a pardon . yesterday prime minister david cameron said : alan turing was a remarkable man who played a key role in saving this country . his action saved countless lives . he also left a remarkable national legacy through his substantial scientific achievements , often being referred to as the father of modern computing . tory mp iain stewart , who represents milton keynes south , home of bletchley park , said he was over the moon that justice has prevailed . rare : only three people have received royal pardons since 1945 : timothy evans , executed for the murder of his wife in 1950 derek bentley , hanged despite being feeble minded and michael shields , right derek bentley 's grave , left , proclaimed that he was a victim of british justice . timothy evans was only pardoned after it emerged serial killer john christie , right , had murdered his wife . by then he had been hanged he said : alan turing made a huge impact on the world he lived in and left a legacy for the world of today and tomorrow . this royal pardon is a just reward for a man who was stripped of his honour , his work , and the loyalty he showed his nation . but gay rights campaigner peter tatchell said : singling out turing just because he is famous is wrong . an apology and pardon is due to another 50,000 plus men who were also convicted of consenting , victimless homosexual relationships during the 20 th century . on 8 june 1954 , turing 's cleaner found him dead . a post mortem examination established the because of death was cyanide poisoning . an inquest determined that he had committed suicide , and he was cremated at woking crematorium on 12 june . several scholars , and even his family , have suggested turing 's death was not suicide and instead either an accident or linked to a conspiracy . when his body was discovered , an apple laid half eaten next to his bed . it was never tested for cyanide but it is speculated it was the source of the fatal does . some more peculiar theories suggest turing was obsessed with fairytale snow white and the seven dwarfs and his death was inspired by the poison apple in the story . the theory was supported in an article in the guardian written by turing 's friend , the author alan garner , in 2011 . however , later evidence suggested that turing habitually ate an apple before bed , and it was not unusual for it to be discarded half eaten . his mother is said to have thought the ingestion was accidental , because by her son 's storage of chemicals in his home . speaking on the 100 th anniversary of alan turing 's birth on 23 rd june 2012 , professor of philosophy jack copeland , university of canterbury , christchurch , new zealand , questioned the evidence given to the inquiry in 1954 . he said there was no evidence of premeditation there was no suicide note and he seemed to be in a cheerful mood in the days leading up to his death . he added that turing 's career was at an all time high and that he would not want to intentionally kill himself . he pointer out that his friend robin gandy stayed with turing a week before his death and he remarked how happy turing seemed finally , the academic remarked that the inquest was so bad that turing could even have been murdered . although it is is unclear who would have wanted to murder him mr copeland said his work at bletchly park was under strict secrecy until well after his death .:==:alan turing led the way in cracking the enigma codes at bletchley park . but he took his own life after 1952 conviction led to his chemical castration . it is only the fourth royal pardon since the end of the second world war . gay rights campaigner peter tatchell said 50,000 more apologies are due .

players in britain but he is refusing to be sent back to the pavilion because of his age , proved by the six batsmen he dismissed for his club side just last week . known as cec to his friends , he moved to oldham in greater manchester in the 1950 s to play league cricket and also represented jamaica , but he still remains the scourge of batsmen . still racing in : cecil wright , who turns 80 in december , remains the scourge of batsmen , taking 7,000 wickets in 65 years icons : cec , as he is known to his friends , played alongside greats of the game including legend viv richards in his last

with on the pitch . in his heyday he played alongside legends of the game including west indies cricket legends sir viv richards , sir frank worrell , sir gary sobers and joel garner as well as england 's denis compton . and he said that despite being old enough to be most of his opponents grandfather he can still teach them a thing or two about the game . cecil who has a son and two grandchildren and who lives in royton , near oldham , said : i ve been playing since i was a young boy and i was a professional for over 50 years so i do not want to finish yet . i ve been lucky with injuries and i have always kept fit so i will keep playing . some of the lads i play against might not expect much from an opponent who is approaching 80 but i am still good enough to get anyone out ,

can we say that the last of the boko haram crisis has been heard ? the answer is a categorical no read more : nigerian president declares emergency in 3 states last weekend , gunmen stormed a school in yobe , killing 20 students and a teacher in an attack local media said had been claimed by boko haram . whereas the nigerian government would say boko haram members are being flushed out , an objective observer would say many are simply hibernating in various northern nigerian communities . locals know who and where they are , but share two related grievances against the nigerian state that is warring against the group . first and foremost , many northern nigerians are unhappy with the way the military carries out its operations . in its pursuit of boko haram , the nigerian military views everything as a legitimate target including mosques , market places , women and children . the people regularly allege the killing of innocent people by the military . they claim to be more afraid of the soldiers than boko haram insurgents . the nigerian military recently told human rights watch that reports of civilian casualties during military raids were grossly exaggerated , but u.s. secretary of state john kerry has warned his nigerian counterpart over alleged atrocities by soldiers . read more : gunmen kill 20 students , teacher in nigerian school shooting the military cannot claim to be winning under this kind of atmosphere . to get local support for a sustainable war against boko haram , the military must invest more in winning the hearts and minds of the people . the alternative is that the people either become bystanders in the war or even supporters of boko haram . the second problem is that the north is not happy with the present regime in nigeria , which has marginalized them politically , socially and economically since the 1999 transition from military to civil rule . the north had previously held the power in nigeria it is now in the opposition . read more : human rights watch report on nigeria violence the north took over from the british colonial masters when nigeria became independent in 1960 . these politicians were overthrown by the military in 1966 but once again the military leaders were northern dominated until they transferred power to civilians in 1999 . since then , northerners grip on the nigerian political system has been very weak it is getting weaker by the day . things are so bad for the north , that the possibility of it reclaiming political power in 2015 is becoming a mirage . if the political situation in nigeria gets messier , the likes of boko haram would fight for the north whether voluntarily or by invitation . for this reason , some northerners might not be too happy with the military suppressing boko haram . such individuals exist within the nigerian military as well . this is why the chief of army staff lt gen . azubuike ihejirika is constantly warning his men and officers not to sabotage the ongoing military operations by providing intelligence to the insurgents . read more : nigerian military insurgents killed in raid on militant camps the boko haram sect cannot be removed from nigerian society like pulling a rotten tooth out of the mouth . a group whose bloodied hands were found in the 2000 to 2003 political violence in borno state a group that two years later emerged as the nigerian taliban before becoming securitized by the nigerian state as boko haram meaning western education is evil cannot be easily sent packing by the nigerian military . boko haram 's members have seen many battles in the past and the group is known to be a cat with many lives . even if it died out , it would germinate in new forms . the needs of boko haram are not even known to the nigerian state not to mention being met by it more problems should be expected . the group might emerge under new name now that it has been banned by the united kingdom and its present leadership has been declared wanted by the united states . read more : nigerians ask , are we at war ? leader abubakar shekau and some of the group 's other senior members have nothing to gain from any permanent peace especially as the international community has already cast them in the mold of former al qaeda leader osama bin laden . as they await eventual capture , they will not mind causing more trouble . to sustain its recent gains , the military task force in the three states will need to take the character of a near permanent formation on the ground . if the military leave , boko haram will quickly come in to fill the space . occasional sniper attacks on soft targets by the group will provide justification for the military to ask for money to keep the northeast safe . in other words , the nigerian military is doing its best but the present situation is only a state of negative peace it is a peace of the graveyard . the committee on dialogue and peaceful resolution of security challenges in the north , set up by the federal government , claimed some days ago it has reached a ceasefire agreement with the boko haram sect . such an agreement must have been reached with a significant faction of the sect . read more : why nigeria 's elections matter if not , where did the group meet the faction led by shekau and what were the terms of the agreement ? what is in the agreement for the boko haram most especially on issues relating to strict enforcement of islamic laws in northern nigeria ? what does it have to say on amnesty for shekau and other leaders of the sect ? the committee members are only trying to save face . the ongoing military operations against the boko haram were launched few days after the committee was set up the members are confused the credibility of their mission is questioned and they have to say something to nigerians before running away . the opinions expressed in this commentary are soley those of isaac olawale albert .:==:boko haram is an islamic militant group that wants to enforce a slamic law in nigeria . nigeria 's president has declared emergencies in three states where the group operates . albert says the military 's tactics are not working and it is failing to win hearts and minds . many northerners share some of the group 's grievances against the state , he says .

the buglife charity said the bumblebee is having a difficult year due to the wet weather insects are struggling with the uk 's wet and cold summer , and are now at very low numbers , according to a wildlife charity . the buglife conservation charity says that bees , wasps , moths and butterflies have all seen their populations drop in 2012 and rare species may be at risk of extinction due to the elements . bees and wasps have struggled to find enough nectar and aphids to feed on , while charity volunteers are reporting less sightings of moths and butterflies . insects are vulnerable to weather changes , and this year has seen some of the heaviest rainfall ever with april and june the wettest quarter ever reported . chief executive matt shardlow told the bbc : they might not recover and could be driven closer to extinction . shardlow said damp conditions have reduced the number of aphids for wasps to feed on , and 250 species of bees were struggling without the high temperatures need to ensure a good supply of nectar and pollen . he said : we are seeing very low numbers of them now , as well as small bumble bees , which is a sign they have not had enough nectar and pollen to feed on however it is not all bad news in the insect world , with creatures that thrive in damp conditions doing well over the wet months . wasps feed on aphids , which are also in decline due to the weather , which leads to a knock on effect in the food chain it is not all bad news : glow worms are having a strong year , thanks to the proliferation of slugs and snails shardlow said drone flies and mosquitoes , and snails and slugs , have seen population booms . he said : this means that anything which feeds on slugs and snails will also benefit this year . we ve had reports of large numbers of glow worms , for example , which feed on slugs and snails . but volunteer counters are reporting a drop in moth and butterfly populations .:==:bees struggling to find nectar , while wasps cannot find enough aphids to eat , says buglife charity . rare species may be at risk of extinction following some of the wettest months on record . but good news for animals that like damp climes , like slugs and snails .

thousands of revelers in shades of green jammed manhattan streets to the tune of bagpipes saturday for the 251 st annual st patrick 's day parade . the parade marched past st patrick 's cathedral , where the landmark building is set to undergo more than $175 million in restorations , considered among the largest renovation projects in its history . cardinal timothy dolan presided there earlier saturday for a mass attended by top city officials , including mayor michael bloomberg . today is a day to celebrate all things irish and that means we have a lot to celebrate , bloomberg told reporters . the irish really have been the center of life for three centuries , and if you look around our administration , it is full of people with names like kelly and tierney and gil hearn and dougherty and hanley and walsh . spectators donned sparkling green top hats and waved tiny irish flags , as a marching band representing new york 's finest drummed their way through gotham . in boston , which also has a large irish population , thousands showed up for the city 's parade that meandered through south boston in the afternoon . officials there have urged restraint in drinking . photos : celebrations go green police commissioner edward davis and mayor thomas menino issued a joint statement saying boston police will be taking steps to increase patrols , focusing not only on the parade route and calls for service , but also at drinking establishments . bars are open until 7 pm , while liquor stores are required to close at 4 pm in chicago , the chicago river was once again dyed green to kick off irish inspired festivities and a parade . irish prime minister enda kenny was on hand for this year 's celebrations in the windy city , sharing the spotlight with mayor rahm emanuel . people are letting loose , singing , dancing , said julie roche , 25 , a manager at chicago 's snuggery pub and sports bar . scores of patrons filed in as soon as the downtown bar opened at 7 am , she said , swelling to larger numbers as the day progressed . president enjoys a pint at the dubliner pub in d c parade goers also jammed the streets of savannah , georgia , where clover clad floats carried green shirted revelers . we had a huge crowd here . the weather was incredible , said julian miller , public affairs administrator for savannah chatham metropolitan police . it has been a very well behaved crowd . we still have tonight . he said there were only a couple minor arrests as of late saturday afternoon . one participant in the parade became ill and was taken away by ambulance , miller said . witnesses told cnn affiliate wtgs that first responders performed cpr on a member of a marching band . miller could not provide precise crowd estimates , but said it was probably in the several hundreds of thousands . even president barack obama partook in the march 17 holiday tradition , enjoying a guinness at a well known capitol hill pub called the dubliner . across the pond , huge crowds packed central dublin , where thousands of spectators waved irish flags as marchers passed by , carrying banners and singing traditional irish songs . i will take in more money today than i normally would in a week , said john hoyne , owner of the brazen head pub , a converted manor that dates to 1775 and is described as dublin 's oldest pub . we are absolutely jammed to capacity . the 50 year old pub owner said the brazen head has 13 bartenders filling up an average of 500 pints of guinness per hour . it is absolutely electric here , he said . dublin crowds also gathered for the much anticipated irish english six nations rugby match up , a rivalry perhaps made more intense by saturday 's festivities . ireland has been reeling from the effects of a banking collapse and the euro zone 's debt crisis , battling high unemployment that currently hovers just above 14 . cnn 's phil gast contributed to this report .:==:huge crowd attends parade in savannah . pub patrons filed into chicago bars starting at 7 am to celebrate , says one manager . the chicago river was dyed green , as it is every year . huge crowds pack central dublin and wave irish flags .

one advantage of the paris motor show clashing with the city 's fashion week is that you just cannot move for supermodels  both on and off the automotive catwalk . claudia schiffer over here one minute , britain 's rosie huntington whiteley over there the next . and then there are the cars . although paris chic was all across the metropolis , the brits did their best to u.s.age their gallic hosts by sticking the british boot in  wellingtons of course . give it welly : rosie huntington whiteley with the new discovery and giant union jack footwear jaguar land rover strove to u.s.age schiffer , who was on an adjacent stage as it struck up the band  a military band including soldiers in red tunics and bearskins  to unveil its new xe sports saloon and land rover discovery sport , for which it has received 1,200 orders in just three weeks . jaguar land rover chief executive dr ralf speth said : these two cars are at the very heart of britain 's manufacturing renaissance . huntington whiteley led the charge by swapping the catwalk for the new discovery sport 's launch on the seine . the 27 year old actress and former victoria 's secret lingerie model boarded a giant 250 ft barge , transformed into floating off road assault course adorned with seven pairs of oversized wellington boots  one of them a 15 ft high pair decorated in the red white and blue union flag . two of the new vehicles then drove around the course as the barge sailed up and down past many of the capital 's most famous landmarks , including the eiffel tower and notre dame cathedral  under the very put out noses of haughty parisians . a spokesman said : the boots , a reference to both the discovery 's versatile seating layout and land rover 's unique take on outdoor life , brought a sense of quintessential british heritage and humour to the rive gauche . claudia schiffer scored highly in the fashion stakes when she unveiled the new vauxhall corsa . it s chic , just like paris , she said of the hot hatchback the seven pairs of giant wellies , made by british firm barbour and becoming something of a fashion statement in paris , were designed to highlight the disco 's seating versatility  two people at the front , three in the middle and two more in the optional folddown seats at the back . costing from £32,395 to £42,995 , the new car replaces the freelander and means an investment , production and jobs boost for the firm 's halewood factory on merseyside . it goes on uk sale on january 22 alongside the existing the larger seven seater , full size discovery . the launch model will deploy an efficient , yet powerful , sd4 fourcylinder diesel engine , four wheel drive , with either advanced ninespeed automatic or six speed manual transmission . an ed4 turbodiesel version is to be introduced later in 2015 from under £30,000 and with frugal co2 estimated at around 119 g km bentley launched its new £252,200 mulsanne speed with a top speed of 190 mph and acceleration from rest to 60 mph of 4.8 seconds . the land rover discovery sport has also received 1,200 orders in three weeks the crewe based luxury car maker , owned by germany 's giant volkswagen group , has recorded its best ever half year sales of 5,252 , a rise of 23 per cent . it is to launch a new suv in 2016 , creating 400 new jobs . brace yourself for bargains . european makers are slashing prices and offering great deals to uk consumers because britain is the only country showing good sales growth . it s all about growth . everyone wants a piece of the action . the last quarter has been particularly competitive , said one executive . claudia schiffer scored highly in the fashion stakes when she unveiled the new vauxhall corsa . it s chic , just like paris , she said of the hot hatchback in what , quite frankly , a rather cheesy and stilted bit of eurovision style scripting . but the corsa is a significant car for britain . it was the second biggest selling car after the fiesta at 83,000 last year  it is actually the biggest seller in scotland . but rolls royce , bentley and jaguar land rover led the british charge of luxury cars at the prestigious motor show as booming export sales propelled them towards new record highs . luxury car brand infiniti produced a bit of a head turner . its eye catching q80 inspiration prototype is a four door fastback with four individual leather seats , while a plunging panoramic glass roof creates a light , airy environment inside . rolls royce is on a roll , said the firm 's chief executive torsten mueller otvos , as he revealed that the luxury firm , based at goodwood in sussex , is on target to break through 4,000 annual sales for the first time . no doubt it will be helped by a raunchy black andwhite , art house style video involving a suspenderclad kylie getting changed in the back of a roller which was shown at a private view at the show , after appearing at some of her concerts . apparently it is called skirt , though i struggled to see much evidence of one .:==:land rover discovery sport has also received 1,200 orders in three weeks . chief executive dr ralf speth said the cars are at the very heart of britain 's manufacturing renaissance . rosie huntington whiteley was the face of the discovery sport 's launch . claudia schiffer unveiled the new vauxhall corsa . it s chic , just like paris , she said of the hot hatchback .

newcastle have announced record profits of £18.7 million for last season but fans say the figures have provoked more questions than answers . the club have not released the full annual report , only selected highlights with no detailed explanation as to how £28.5 million of extra costs have been incurred . mark jensen , editor of online fanzine themag . co uk , said he had expected profits for the 201314 campaign to be closer to £50 million given the increase in income from television rights and the sale of yohan cabaye to paris st germain for around £20 million . yohan cabaye poses with his new team jersey after a news conference at the parc des princes stadium newcastle also reported revenues increased by 35 per cent from £95.9 million to £129.7 million . more than half of newcastle 's income £78.3 million came from the premier league television rights deals , with commercial income also increasing . jensen told press association sport : this has just provoked more questions than answers . there is £28.5 million of costs for which there is no explanation . the wages to turnover ratio is also not included . we had anticipated a profit of around £50 m , especially with cabaye being sold . the way that most fans look at it is that newcastle did not buy a single player in the whole season and sold cabaye . everyone knows how much these clubs are getting from tv so newcastle fans would like to think more profit would mean more team strengthening but that has not been the case . cabaye moved to psg in a deal worth more than £20 million and the reports have left questions to answer there seems to be both a lack of transparency and ambition . newcastle finished 10 th last season and are currently 12 th in the premier league table . a newcastle statement said : most significantly , the club reported strong commercial revenue growth delivering £25.6 million in 2014 , up from £17.1 million in 2013 . this 49.7 per cent increase was largely the result of two lucrative new deals with the club 's principal sponsors , wonga and puma . it is the fourth successive year the club has made a profit and cements newcastle 's positions in financial terms as one of the most successful in the top flight . everton made a profit last season of £28.2 m , manchester united £23.9 million , chelsea £18.4 m and arsenal £4.7 million while sunderland lost £16.9 million and manchester city made a £23 million loss . newcastle 's debt remained static at £129 million in the form of an interest free loan from owner mike ashley none of the debt has been repaid . newcastle 's debt remained static at £129 million in the form of an interest free loan from owner mike ashley newcastle managing director lee charnley said : i am pleased to report a positive set of results which confirms the healthy financial position the club now finds itself in and is a reflection of the prudent and measured manner in which we operate . the club benefits from a supportive owner and is financially stable . this gives us a strong platform from which to grow , both on and off the pitch , a result of which means , as we move forward , we are able to net spend on the playing squad and invest in other areas of the business . the most pleasing aspect in this set of accounts has been the growth in our commercial revenue and it has been our strongest year yet in that respect . with our commitment to keeping ticket prices affordable for our supporters growing our commercial income has been crucial . the deals we struck with our two main sponsors , wonga and puma , together with a stronger focus on our commercial operations , have helped us achieve this growth . we believe financial stability will deliver positive on field results for the club . the announcement prompted an outbreak of sarcastic humour from fans on social media , with gallowgateshots posting : £nufc fans flock to the streets in masses to celebrate their record profit win .:==:newcastle have announced record profits of £18.7 million for last season . the club have not released the full annual report , only selected highlights . no explanation as to how £28.5 million of extra costs have been incurred . includes sale of yohan cabaye to paris st germain for around £20 million .

one look at rory mcilroy told you that a life of splendour and a world of riches is still no protection from the turmoil caused by affairs of the heart . here was rory with all the privileges stripped away , just another 25 year old struggling like so many with true love and all that it means . during his short press conference at wentworth on wednesday , he answered one question with the distant look of a man with his mind placed firmly somewhere else . there was one awful moment during another when he looked like he might lose it completely . in the balance : rory mcilroy 's split from fiancee caroline wozniacki has threatened his chances in the pga championship happy couple : mcilroy proposed to tennis player wozniacki in december going steady : the pair had been an item for over two years down : the pair pictured last week only sent out invitations to their wedding at the weekend this was mcilroy as we have not seen him , wrought and strung out . a man who did not appear in any fit mental state to make a decent fist of playing in the european tour s flagship event , the bmw pga championship which , lest we forget , begins on thursday . who knows the reason for the break up , which comes only a few days after the wedding invitations were sent out . less than a month ago , caroline wozniacki was talking of starting a family and mcilroy was tweeting a photo of their scenic location for dinner only last friday . let us hope there really is nothing more to it than the official explanation of cold feet . but the news certainly caught everyone cold on the practice ground . i m surprised , i think we all must be , said luke donald . typical mcilroy , to front up and answer questions when things have gone wrong . what he must surely be asking himself , though , is why things are always going off track . here was one more twist to the legend : it always seems to happen to rory . one of these days he will have a season where all the talk is about golf but it doesn t look as if it will be any time soon . nice to see you : mcilroy is offered words of wisdom from television legend sir bruce forsyth in awe : man united fan mcilroy played alongside phil neville , teddy sheringham and peter schmeichel hero status : mcilroy was distracted by sheringham , who won the treble with united in 1999 gobsmacked : schmeichel won five premier league titles during a successful stay at old trafford gift : neville presented mcilroy with a united shirt which appeared to brighten his mood the main man : sheringham , schmeichel and neville watch on mcilroy takes a shot this time last year the break up in question was with his manager , conor ridge . the year before that he made the startling confession that he had taken his eye off the ball . i ve spent enough time with lawyers this year to last me a lifetime , he said wistfully last november . now , as we head into the meat of the season with this prestigious event followed by three majors in as many months before the ryder cup in september , here we go again . fifteen months ago , ernie els got to play with rory when his mind was whirling so much he walked off the course at the honda classic after nine holes . on thursday afternoon , the great south african will get another close up of a distracted mcilroy as they have been drawn together in the first round . how on earth can you play with such a huge obstacle between you and thinking clearly ? the only thing mcilroy s got going for him today is that he has had plenty of practice , although perhaps nothing quite so distracting as this . i m not going to lie , i think it is going to be very difficult , said mcilroy . when i get inside the ropes i m just going to try to concentrate on the shot at hand but that s easier said than done . fatherly advice : mcilroy speaks to his dad , gerry mcilroy ahead of the pga championship at wentworth sergio garcia was so cut up after he was dumped by greg norman s daughter morgan leigh that eventually he took some time away from the game . i ll definitely be putting an arm around rory s shoulder and asking if he wants to talk about it , said the spaniard . i ve been through it from both sides . i split up with martina hingis but morgan was the one who left me it should be easier if it s mutual but when it is a really painful break up the temptation to throw yourself into golf more than ever doesn t always work out . every case is different but for me i had to stop playing for a while . right now , mcilroy is determined to plough on in eight strokeplay tournaments this year , he has finished outside the top 10 only once but now that consistent spell of form has to be set against yet another off course complication . a friend in need : sergio garcia will offer mcilroy someone to talk to if he needs donald said : obviously i wish both of them the best but i m guessing this is going to be very distracting for rory . we know how hard this game is when you have a clear mind , and i can t imagine what s going through his head now . mcilroy stepped back into the public spotlight on wednesday with three former manchester united footballers for company , in the shape of peter schmeichel , teddy sheringham and phil neville . a lifelong united fan , he must have been thinking a week ago that this was a pro am round he could really savour , rather than a chore . now there was a rueful grin as he shook hands with each in turn . his dad gerry was there beside the first tee as well , offering moral support . this time last year the build up to this tournament was overshadowed by an ill advised remark from garcia about tiger woods , made at an awards dinner designed to celebrate the winning of the ryder cup . now it is affairs of the heart that have taken the place of matters of race . it is such a shame . just like last year , a heck of a golf tournament is bursting to break out on thursday . this is the 60 th anniversary of the pga and the biggest one yet , with record crowds expected to descend on this beautiful corner of england to greet virtually everyone who is anyone in the european game . let us hope it emerges . but , right now , mcilroy s bombshell is the only topic in town . all change then : mcilroy posted this tweet just last week which did not indicate any problems since meeting in july 2011 , rory mcilroy and caroline wozniacki have had their fair share of career u.s.and downs . 2011 : mcilroy comes 64 th at the uspga , leaves his management team and finishes the year ranked world no 3 . wozniacki loses to serena williams in us open semi final and ends the year as world no 1 for the second time . 2012 : mcilroy wins the uspga , the ryder cup , tops the european and us money lists and is world no 1 . wozniacki makes australian open quarter final but loses in the first round at wimbledon and the us open . 2013 : mcilroy signs a $155 m nike deal but loses form , quits the honda classic mid round and drops to world no 6 . wozniacki fails to make it past the fourth round in any of the grand slams , but maintains her top 10 ranking . 2014 : mcilroy starts with seven top 10 finishes but drops to world no 11 in april , his lowest ranking in three years . wozniacki a change of racket and injuries see her struggling for form and drop out of the world 's top 10 .:==:mcilroy looked affected by the split from his fiancee caroline wozniacki . latest distraction after split from manager conor ridge last year . talks of desire to focus on golf but may not be able to do that . offered support by fellow golfers luke donald and sergio garcia . met man united heroes peter schmeichel , teddy sheringham and phil neville . pga championship starts at wentworth on thursday .

despite regularly changing their roost , bats will choose to lodge with the same social groups of friends following each move , claims research . by tracking movements of bats in oxfordshire woods , researchers discovered that different social groups roost in separate , though adjacent , parts of woodland . the findings have important implications for conservation as bats may not be able to move to another area if a section of woodland is felled . a study carried out over five years in wytham woods , oxfordshire has found that bats like to stick together . this image shows a network analysis of how individual bats interact in social groups . nearly 1,500 bats were fitted with small aluminium arm bands to make the findings the research was carried out by scientists from the centre for ecology and hydrology , the university of exeter and the university of oxford . experts concluded that the structure of bat social groups differs between two different , but closely related , species living in the same woodland . bats are pictured roosting together in oxford the study was carried out over a five year period in wytham woods , oxfordshire . nearly 1,500 bats were fitted with small aluminium arm bands , and four bats were tagged with lightweight radio transmitters . the radio tracking showed the bats changed roost site about once every two days . each social group was found to occupy a home patch in the wood . although the bat species occupied the same area of woodland , the home patches of the different social groups within the species did not overlap , suggesting that social groups may defend their roost areas . one species , called natterer s bat myotis nattereri forms mixed sex social groups , while a second species , the daubenton s bat myotis daubentonii , has largely separate male and female groups . dr tom august from the centre for ecology and hydrology , who conducted the study , said : when the first results came through it was a real eureka moment , i hadn t expected to see so many separate social groups in the woodland . the study was carried out over a five year period in wytham woods , oxfordshire . nearly 1,500 bats were fitted with small aluminium arm bands , and four bats were tagged with tiny lightweight radio transmitters to enable them to be tracked . the radio tracking showed that the bats changed roost site frequently about once every two days . each social group was found to occupy a home patch in the wood . although the two bat species occupied the same area of woodland , the home patches of the different social groups within the species did not overlap , suggesting that social groups may defend their roost areas . the relationships between bats in the same social groups were found to be enduring , in many cases lasting more than a year . dr mathews from the university of exeter who led the research team added : this work has really important practical implications for bat conservation . the research at wytham woods shown on map was carried out by scientists from the centre for ecology and hydrology , the university of exeter and the university of oxford experts concluded that the structure of bat social groups differs between two different , but closely related species living in the same woodland . one species , called natterer s bat shown left , forms mixed sex social groups , while a second species , the daubenton s bat , has largely separate male and female groups . we now realise that although social groups of woodland bats move house every few days , they remain within a very small geographical range . this means that even quite small scale tree felling may destroy all the roosts potentially available to a group . the research has highlighted that the social networks of animals are poorly understood , but they are fundamentally important to processes ranging from information transfer to the spread of disease . dr matthews concluded : just as some types of people are super connected on facebook , this work shows that in animal systems , two very closely related species living in the same habitat can have very different kinds of social network . the findings are published in the journal plos one .:==:study was carried out over five years in wytham woods , oxfordshire . nearly 1,500 bats were fitted with small aluminium arm bands . four bats tagged with radio transmitters enabled all the bats to be tracked . radio tracking showed the bats changed roost site once every two days . but each social group was found to occupy a home patch in the wood . findings have important implications for conservation as bats may not be able to move to another area if a section of woodland is felled .

most people probably would like to assume that if they were awoken at 6:30 in the morning by a drunk , naked stranger in their bedroom who would just smeared his own feces throughout their house and tried to flood their kitchen that the intoxicated intruder would be arrested when police ultimately show up that , however , was not the case for a couple in kuma , idaho , who say that exact scenario played out in their home earlier this month in their case , they say responding officers did not arrest the drunken poop smearer , they only cited him for a misdemeanor and let him go home . as if that was not enough , homeowners tricia and jake gillaspy had just moved into the home a week prior to the alleged fecal artist 's predawn intrusion . shocked : tricia and jake gillaspy were stunned to find matthew coomes naked in their bedroom at 6:30 am crappy situation : after chasing coomes out of the house at gunpoint , the couple found feces ground into their carpet the incident occurred in the early hours of june 15 father 's day when the gillaspys awoke to find the drunken man standing in their bedroom at 6:30 am my husband 's like , what the heck is going on ? and , i am screaming in utter panic , tricia gillaspy tells ktvb . the intruder , later identified as 25 year old matthew coomes , had clearly been drinking . the couple says that after a naked coomes had woken them up , he tried to run into another room and put some clothes on my husband grabs the gun because we have no idea who this guy is , said tricia . he s like , get out of my house , now but the guy would not leave . so , he puts the gun to his head , and says , i said , get out he is like , there is a guy in my house . i am going to shoot him , you better get a cop here now , she said . art ? the gillaspys say they found feces smeared all over their walls and appliances feces : coomes allegedly took aim at the couple 's oven after smearing feces on the walls coomes eventually left the house , but remained on the couple 's property until police arrived . that is when the couple discovered what coomes allegedly had been doing prior to his waking them up he took this sink sprayer out and this drawer was in there . he put it in the drawer , turned it on full blast hot water , it filled that entire drawer full . it flooded my entire kitchen , said tricia . he craps on my floor , and he must have been playing in it because he streaked it down the side of my walls . the stain is gone finally , thank goodness . when police arrived , rather than arrest the drunk , naked man who had just terrified an innocent couple , the responding officers cited coomes for the misdemeanors and took him back to his house . i go running out the door , and am like , what are you doing ? i am like , this guy deserves to go to jail gillaspy said . tricia says she later learned that the damage allegedly caused by coomes cost more than $5,000 to repair . in the following days , tricia received a call from a kuna police sergeant who told her the officers should have arrested coomes on the spot . flood : the couple says coomes used their sink sprayer to flood the drawers in their kitchen gross : not factoring in grossness , the couple says the damage cost more than $5,000 to repair the kuna police department says it is conducting an internal investigation into why coomes was not arrested the morning of the incident . additionally , prosecutors have since filed felony charges against coomes for malicious injury to property for the extensive and expensive damage he did to the home . investigators say it appears coones entered the home through an unlocked backdoor . he later told police that he did not remember going into the home or using the sprayer in the kitchen . additionally , he says he also does not recall how his feces ended up on the gillaspys carpet and how his underwear ended up on their floor .:==:tricia and jake gillaspy say they woke up to find a naked matthew coomes standing in their bedroom at 6:30 am coomes , 25 , refused to leave until gillaspy got his gun . when police arrived , the gillaspys discovered what coomes allegedly had been doing before he woke them up the couple found feces smeared on the walls and the drawers filled with water . police did not arrest coomes the night of the incident , they just drove him home . the police department have since said coomes should have been arrested and he is now charged with a felony .

princess anne 's suggestion that britons need to reconsider their reluctance to eat horse meat was brave and reflects a sad decline in horses value , the head of a horse welfare charity says . addressing the world horse welfare conference thursday , princess anne queen elizabeth ii 's daughter and the organization 's president suggested that making horse meat more valuable might lead to better treatment of the animals . the olympic equestrian referred to the transport of horses from countries such as poland , the source of some horse meat , saying many horses left looking absolutely wonderful but suffered in transit . it is worth noting transport of horses itself is the problem not the horses or indeed the way they were brought up , she said . if that is true then and they value their horses they look after them well because they are in the horse meat trade and it is the transport that is the problem , should we be considering a real market for horse meat , and would that reduce the number of welfare cases ? the princess suggested that our attitudes to the horse meat trade . and the value of horse meat might have to change . i chuck that out for what it is worth because i think it needs a debate , she said . she noted that britain 's attitude to horse meat was not universal . as i was reminded , not so long ago , by somebody who would traveled in france , the most expensive piece of meat in the local butcher was a fillet of horse meat , she said . the value of the animal to every individual is slightly different , but if it has real financial value , then you look a little bit further ahead in the way in which you look after your animals . world horse welfare chief executive roly owers said the princess royal had made her point within the context of the equine crisis we are currently in when ponies are being sold for as little as â£5 $8 . around 7,000 horses are currently at risk of abandonment and neglect and charities like ours are struggling to cope as winter approaches , owers said in a statement . the economic downturn has driven prices for horses and ponies to rock bottom , and the sad fact is that from a purely economic perspective , they can now be worth more as meat . many in the horse world have known this for a long time . our president has been brave enough to say this openly in hopes of generating a thought provoking debate . overbreeding in britain the underlying problem , owers told cnn , was the issue of overbreeding in britain . there are too many horses and too few homes . owers said he believed anne was caring but also practical . she was not actually saying , get out there and buy horse meat . she was saying , we should be open to the debate about it and if the horse goes into the food chain , will it reduce welfare problems ? owers said the option of sending a horse to a slaughterhouse was one that should be available to people . the issue is not those horses going to an abattoir it is not that they are going to slaughter that is the problem it is that they are simply not fit and healthy when they reach there , he said . owers said he knew of people delaying euthanizing horses because they could not afford the expense to call out a vet and to dispose of a carcass . emotional issue britain has a different attitude toward horses than some of its european neighbors , with the idea of eating horse meat an emotional one , he said . on the continent they are viewed as farm animals to a far greater degree here they are seen as pets , leisure or sport animals . the debate would be different if horses were regarded in the same light as pigs , sheep or cows , he said . as a country we have eaten horse meat in the past we did in the second world war , but you could argue that it was a time of crisis , owers said . britain 's royal society for the protection and care of animals said it welcomed any debate on horse welfare issues . our centers , and those of other charities , are overflowing with horses which have been abandoned , neglected and abused , and we are struggling to keep up with the demands for our help , it said in a statement . the killing of horses for meat is an emotive subject as many see them as companion animals rather than a food source , a sentiment the rspca has great sympathy with . however , the society 's primary concern for all animals killed for meat and otherwise is that they are cared for , handled and transported in a way which safeguards their welfare at all times .:==:princess anne has suggested that britons reconsider their reluctance to eat horse meat . she says an increase in the value of horse meat might lead to better horse welfare . the ceo of world horse welfare says there are too many horses and too few homes . this problem has caused a decline in the value of horses and their treatment , he says .
